Layer 4 load balancing vs Layer 7 load balancing

At Layer 7, a load balancer has application awareness and can use this additional application information to make more complex and informed load balancing decisions. With a protocol such as HTTP, a load balancer can uniquely identify client sessions based on cookies and use this information to deliver all a clients requests to the same server. This server persistence using cookies can be based on the serverâ€™s cookie or by active cookie injection where a load balancer cookie is inserted into the connection.
