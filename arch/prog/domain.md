Surround model and its context with a boundary

Explicitly map between different contexts

model transactional boundaries as aggregates

invariant rules across your domain model - model the invariants and assocaited entity/values as aggregates - aggregates focus on transactional boundaries - individual aggregates are transactional consistent 

between aggregates consistency is relaxed

between bounded contexts, consistency is relaxed
