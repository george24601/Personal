Tech middle tier: Microservice platform, DevOps platform, Paas, container cloud ....

Microservice service platform: user center, order center ...

system of record: accouting, ERP, CRM, delivery flow, focused on efficiency and regulation

system of differientiation is for the innovation speed of the front platform. Note system of innovation has the final call on the shape of the SoD - need to be customer obsessed

### From alibaba
Supercell: 2-7 members per team. The team decides what to build, and fast trial and error in the span of a few weeks - behind it common assets and algos

common platform BU has hard time satifying needs from multiple external BUs

between alicloud and frontend - user , goods, transaction, comment

for soa,after launch, little new funcions-creates new tunnel because of inertia of maintaining existing services

loss of domain knowledge after relaunching-rebuilding

need to understand domain deeply

service does not need stable business, that is how simple service grows to the most valuable IT assets - specific domain expert -> helps innovation in business

KPI- rough range:
40% -  stability < 2 P1 incidents within half year
25% - innovation , 1 P1 or 2 P2 introduced due to innovation
20% - service acceptance rate 0%
10% -satifaction from front end teams 360 degree review - to avoid arrogance from middle tier team
