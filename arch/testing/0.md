### integration test
verify that module can communiate sufficiently rather than to acceptance test the external component => gateway integration

Write only a handful of integration tests to provde fast feedback when needed and provide additonal coverage with unit test and contract test

out of process component tests => stub external service

contract testing is not component testing => contract test suites written by each consumering team are runanble in the build pipelines for the producing services => check framework?

probably still need some stub for end-to-end testing => write as few end-to-end as possible, time budget should be in the order of minutes

use DSL to express user journeys => total end-to-end coverage is traded in favour of reliability in the suite

make test data-independent: build a reproducable world view

fake users exercising real ranscations against the prod system=> avoid e-to-e , and use thorough production monitoring and testing direclty against prod

### stress testing

READ - log online traffic, push it to the stress testing platform

WRITE - script to simulate scenario

color the test data to seperate it from real data. Asynchly add pressure in a step by step way

Such stress testing is done online, outside service we creates mock, e.g., outside bank API

Quickly downgrade services used by the critical path to trade UX for platform stability

be defensive - don't rely on downstream's promise
