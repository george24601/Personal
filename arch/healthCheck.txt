Ideas
have different status code associate with different failures
need to avoid false positives 

use error code 503
health check should be private, i.e. only within company, but could be public if returned message is generic enough
 
should external service monitores independently? probably..
------
sample endpoint 

/v1/health/node/<node> 

/v1/health/service/<service>

-----
probably implement healthcheck from user story perspective

also, the status/health check can be a health check that got mixed into main API
