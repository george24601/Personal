Very important to consider the logout scenario! 

separate authen and authorization filter

Refresh tokens are stored in DB and will have long expiration (example: 1 month).

Authorization header is not a simple header, hence a pre-flight request would be required for all the requests to a particular URLs.

But this happens if you are sending Content-Type: application/json for instance. So this is already happening for most applications.

One small caveat, the OPTIONS request won't have the Authorization header itself, so your web framework should support treating OPTIONS and the subsequent requests differently


Managing it at the microservice level is definitely a simpler and more straight forward approach. For us, the reason why we chose a central authorization is because we want to be able to create new permissions and map them to endpoints directly via a UI. This is especially important since we have different apps that might be accessing the same endpoints and different permissions will need access to those endpoints.


Google Cloud Endpoints handles both API keys and authentication schemes (such as Firebase or Auth0). The main distinction between these two is:

API keys identify the calling project — the app or site — making the call to an API

Auth tokens identify a user — the person — that is using the app or site

-------

Relying party applications, such as web applications, outsource the user authentication step to a trusted identity provider. Such a relying party application is said to be federated, that is, it consumes federated identity.

A federated identity in information technology is the means of linking a person's electronic identity and attributes, stored across multiple distinct identity management systems

An identity provider is “a trusted provider that lets you use single sign-on (SSO) to access other websites.”

---------

You can also implement your own provider if you have users in other stores, such as a relational database.

In a standard OAuth, the key is created by the each site. In OpenID Connect, the keys are created by the UserInfo Endpoint. In another word, site X,Y,Z knows how to understand the keys provided by the UserInfo endpoint. For this to happen, the sites must (1) Trust the key providing party (2) be able to verify the validity of the keys. To achieve this, OpenID Connect uses JSON Web Token (JWT) as the format for the key (Access Token) using some cryptography
support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application (though you should never expose your secret API key in any public website's client-side code

### stripe

To make the API as explorable as possible, accounts have test mode and live mode API keys. There is no "switch" for changing between modes, just use the appropriate key to perform a live or test transaction.

You can manage your API keys in the Dashboard

The first, preferred, authentication option is to use your—the platform account’s—secret key and pass a Stripe-Account header identifying the connected account for which the request is being mad

Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth.
