Power Sales Negotiators know that splitting the difference does not mean splitting it down the middle. Just split the difference twice and the split becomes 75 percent/25 percent. Furthermore, you may be able to get the other party to split the difference three or more times.

The first thing to remember is that you should never offer to split the difference yourself, but always encourage the other person to offer to split the difference.

Remember that the essence of Power Sales Negotiating is to always leave the other side thinking that they won.

### Selling The Top Of The Line (TOTL)

First promote an expensive product. Then show them a cheaper product.

This can be done without really trying to sell the expensive product. Do it as if you are just a kind of product geek who is proud of what can be done and want to show off great products. Then become the friend who sells them a product that suits them best.

You can also try to sell the expensive product if they seem to be interested. Expensive products are sought by the affluent and those who value the social kudos the product gives. If they seem like the latter, add 'what people will say' into your patter.

If they reject the expensive product, then it is a simple step to move down to the cheaper product.

Selling the top of the line' is a common approach that is a variant of the Door In The Face (DITF) method.

Acting as a 'product geek' in showing off the more expensive item establishes the sales person as an expert and can help to build trust. Note that serious attempts to sell the expensive product may negate or even invert these effects.

The more expensive product creates desire, but cannot be afforded. The second product hooks into the created desire with something that is closer to the buyers budget. The method uses the contrast principle to make the second product appear relatively inexpensive.

If that is true of writing fiction, you can be sure it is true of dealing with people face-to-face.

he nevertheless had made one error: he should have begun by talking about his own shortcomings and Wilhelm’s superiority - not by intimating that the Kaiser was a half-wit in need of a guardian.

Frequently he would say, after he had dictated a letter, “What do you think of this?” In looking over a letter of one of his assistants, he would say, “Maybe if we were to phrase it this way it would be better.” He always gave people the opportunity to do things themselves;

I noticed that the moment a dog showed the slightest improvement, Pete patted and praised him and gave him meat and made a great to-do about it.

What Mr. Roper did was not just flatter the young printer and say “You’re good.” He specifically pointed out how his work was superior Because he had singled out a specific accomplishment, rather than just making general flattering remarks, 

In short, if you want to improve a person in a certain aspect, act as though that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics. Shakespeare said “Assume a virtue, if you have it not.” And it might be well to assume and state openly that other people have the virtue you want them to develop. Give them a fine reputation to live up to, and they will make prodigious efforts rather than see you disillusioned.

was following one of the important rules of human relations: Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest. - this may mean you need to devise some creative incentive schemes.

No, after expressing his appreciation of the invitation and regretting his inability to accept it, he suggested a substitute speaker. In other words, he didn’t give the other person any time to feel unhappy about the refusal, He immediately changed the other person’s thoughts to some other speaker who could accept the invitation.

Create responsibility and titles as toys for people, this will also instill a sense of ownership

Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person.

Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.

When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit.

It taught him an invaluable lesson in the art of dealing with people. Never again did he write an insulting letter. Never again did he ridicule anyone. And from that time on, he almost never criticized anybody for anything.

So, as I have already said, Lincoln put the letter aside, for he had learned by bitter experience that sharp criticisms and rebukes almost invariably end in futility.

Use people's first names as much as you call. Average person is interested in his own name way more than other's - Good manners are made of petty sacrifices

You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself.

Be wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so.

Merely stating a truth isn’t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. Use multiple senses at the same time!

People tend to avoid losses than acquiring gains. Therefore, instead of taking stuff from people, construct a scenario where they are willing to give themselves.

To trigger other people's bragging and make them feel good: time + scenario + slightly irritating/negative experience + positively peak as the end.

Persons in crisis resist the request to talk because, as Stokoe points out, cultural idioms encourage us to put little value on “talk”. After all, “talk is cheap” and “talking the talk” is less meaningful than “walking the walk”. However, a single word substitution could be enough to save a life.

Perhaps because we do not have equivalent cultural idioms, “speak” seems to work. In real conversations between a negotiator and person in crisis, when the negotiator says “speak” (“I wanna come down and I wanna speak to you…”) they get their desired response. 

It is effective for several reasons; it is not a question, it is a statement, and it allows the caller to frame themselves as a good person while not having to backtrack on blaming the other party.

“Is there something else you want to address in the visit today?”. A third group acted as a control and said nothing to solicit further concerns. In doing so, the researchers were able to test the effectiveness of the words “any-“ and “some-“ when used in open-ended questions.

Questions with “Yes” or “No” answers are very useful for getting information quickly, like whether the person in trouble is breathing. But more subtle questions, such as what colour the person looks, might need further prompting. In this case, a “menu” of possible answers is required, but it is important that the menu contains at least three options, otherwise it might lead someone towards an inaccurate answer.

Take this exchange from the fateful Dallas call described at the start of this article:

Dispatcher: “Okay is this a house or an apartment?”

Caller: “It… it is a home”.
