### Selling The Top Of The Line (TOTL)

First promote an expensive product. Then show them a cheaper product.

You can also try to sell the expensive product if they seem to be interested. Expensive products are sought by the affluent and those who value the social kudos the product gives. If they seem like the latter, add 'what people will say' into your patter.

If they reject the expensive product, then it is a simple step to move down to the cheaper product.

Selling the top of the line' is a common approach that is a variant of the Door In The Face (DITF) method.

Acting as a 'product geek' in showing off the more expensive item establishes the sales person as an expert and can help to build trust. Note that serious attempts to sell the expensive product may negate or even invert these effects.

The more expensive product creates desire, but cannot be afforded. The second product hooks into the created desire with something that is closer to the buyers budget. The method uses the contrast principle to make the second product appear relatively inexpensive.
