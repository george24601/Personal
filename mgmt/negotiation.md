Power Sales Negotiators know that splitting the difference does not mean splitting it down the middle. Just split the difference twice and the split becomes 75 percent/25 percent. Furthermore, you may be able to get the other party to split the difference three or more times.

The first thing to remember is that you should never offer to split the difference yourself, but always encourage the other person to offer to split the difference.

Remember that the essence of Power Sales Negotiating is to always leave the other side thinking that they won.

### Selling The Top Of The Line (TOTL)

First promote an expensive product. Then show them a cheaper product.

You can also try to sell the expensive product if they seem to be interested. Expensive products are sought by the affluent and those who value the social kudos the product gives. If they seem like the latter, add 'what people will say' into your patter.

If they reject the expensive product, then it is a simple step to move down to the cheaper product.

Selling the top of the line' is a common approach that is a variant of the Door In The Face (DITF) method.

Acting as a 'product geek' in showing off the more expensive item establishes the sales person as an expert and can help to build trust. Note that serious attempts to sell the expensive product may negate or even invert these effects.

The more expensive product creates desire, but cannot be afforded. The second product hooks into the created desire with something that is closer to the buyers budget. The method uses the contrast principle to make the second product appear relatively inexpensive.

To trigger other people's bragging and make them feel good: time + scenario + slightly irritating/negative experience + positively peak as the end.

Instead of use "talk", Perhaps because we do not have equivalent cultural idioms, “speak” seems to work. In real conversations between a negotiator and person in crisis, when the negotiator says “speak” (“I wanna come down and I wanna speak to you…”) they get their desired response. 

It is effective for several reasons; it is not a question, it is a statement, and it allows the caller to frame themselves as a good person while not having to backtrack on blaming the other party.

“Is there something else you want to address in the visit today?”. A third group acted as a control and said nothing to solicit further concerns. In doing so, the researchers were able to test the effectiveness of the words “any-“ and “some-“ when used in open-ended questions.

Questions with “Yes” or “No” answers are very useful for getting information quickly, like whether the person in trouble is breathing. But more subtle questions, such as what colour the person looks, might need further prompting. In this case, a “menu” of possible answers is required, but it is important that the menu contains at least three options, otherwise it might lead someone towards an inaccurate answer.

Take this exchange from the fateful Dallas call described at the start of this article:

Dispatcher: “Okay is this a house or an apartment?”

Caller: “It… it is a home”.
