# Scenario:  You are in a position of authority and need to issue an unpopular decision from your supervisor  

Options: 
1. just issue the decision, espeicially ones applying to everyone and/or the decision is from your supervisor 
2. Ask people to give feedback directly to the issuser, most likely your supervisor.

# Scenario: Sudden bad news/crisis

Options: 
1. From competitors, find their weakness to exchange, or escalate that into a common/general problem to shift focus
2. From public/users, transparent on all known
3. Product, slient/fallback/stay low.

Note often these things appear together. Need to identify which is the main one

# Scenario: authority issues a decision you deemed incorrect

1. You may disagree, but have to commit. Otherwise, people may use the same reason to reject your decision
2. However, you may do something at execution level,e.g., commit by doing small scale PoC and let facts speak.
3. Once the boss made the decision, it is our job to fulfill the vision within the boss's framework. Don't expect to influence the boss too much on the decision. In general, do not try to change people

# Scenario: rejected by the authority in front of your subordinates

1. Know that the authority often has a different context - thus, complaining only shows that you are narrow minded
2. One way is to not talk about that, and let time dilute the effect

# Scenario: sudden incidents need to address

1. Need to keep the main objectives in mind all the time - can put such accidents on low priority
3. If incidents from external, focus on that as it brings more impact. If it is internal, emphasize on it will give a (false) impression of internal disorganization

# Scenario: got blamed for things out of your scope

1. explain that not within your scope
2. offer your solution - put more emphasis on what you can do to help solve the problem.

### commanded by bosses's boss directly
1. Should obey the command
2. explain current context including boss's direction
3. let the boss know the change and command as soon as time permits

### Someone wants to gossip with you
1. Be very explict you are not interested
2. Change topic
3. If keeps happening, report to his manager

Shut up on issues related to money and people management - that is the management's job

Importance is to bring value to the boss. Do not to use threatening with resigning and active rejection

If you are part of a team effort and the team effort succeeds, the right note to hit is not “I owe it all to my team” unless your position is such that everyone will understand you are lying to be modest.  Try for “It was a privilege to assist my team by leading their efforts with regards to $YOUR_SPECIALTY.”

stay silent to see if the other side can pursue you

don't mention things you hear in different locations, at least don't frame as such

find a way to reply with equal or more amount of information to keep conversation going

Actual grooming is at least moderately important, too, because people are hilariously easy to hack by expedients such as dressing appropriately for the situation, maintaining a professional appearance, speaking in a confident tone of voice, etc. 

When the message is not clear, guess one direction and trial and error
