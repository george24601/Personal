### On Slides

One thing to avoid—slides with a lot of text, especially if it’s a repeat of what you’re saying out loud. It’s like if you give a paper handout in a meeting—everyone’s head goes down and they read, rather than staying heads-up and listening. If there are a lot of words on your slide, you’re asking your audience to split their attention between what they’re reading and what they’re hearing. That’s really hard for a brain to do, and it compromises the effectiveness of both your slide text and your spoken words. If you can’t avoid having text-y slides, try to progressively reveal text (like unveiling bullet points one by one) as you need it.
.

Have no more than six lines of text per slide.

The 7 x 7 rule states that no slide should contain more than 7 lines of text and 7 words per line. The recommended word limit total varies widely from 6 to 40 words per slide.

 Your slides should serve as an outline that highlights the key points to make

  Eliminate orphans to help maximize font size, reduce the total number of words per slide, and create a professional look.  Eliminating orphans is as easy as rewording the bullet-point, resizing the text box, or resizing the font.

Something that can be read is documentation (regardless of which software application you’re using), not presentation (which is an audio – and sometimes visual – communication). You can’t optimize for both at the same time, and trying to do both in one PowerPoint deck just means you’re sub-optimal at both documentation and presentation.

dont directly continue from the first slide

Go for one, poignant textual point per slide, and one high-quality image.

put space between bulletin points

Too many slides = death. Cut content. Be ruthless. Each slide should last for 1.5 mins

intro-background-solution-result: 3:3:5:5

Slide titles are prime real estate: Use slide content to prove your point(may need multiple slides though)

Claims 15 in slide titles => strong story line

Use log log‐scale: ‐ when range spans 2+

orders of magnitude ‐ to highlight ratios instead of difference
