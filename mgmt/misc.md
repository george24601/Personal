structured procastination - work on something important but not urgent!

That sounds like how all my best managers have worked, whether on site or remote. Their job is to facilitate your work, not control it.

“International team” where expectation and default cultural bias are major issues.

Wait for problems before you introduce solutions (esp. processes or infrastructure)

You really want to be attached to Profit Centers because it will bring you higher wages, more respect, and greater opportunities for everything of value to you

if you are checking your phone couple of seconds, it is a sign you are tired, fatigued

Remember, part of your job now is to define what work needs to be done. Your boss won't always be able to tell you what to do, and she probably expects you to tell her what needs to be done. Use this time to answer that question.

Don’t go bringing problems based on people from other teams complaining to you. Those teams need to bring up the problems themselves. If you must, tell their manager that you’re hearing these complaints, and let that manager decide whether to deal with it.

 Expect this feedback, buy-in, and revision process to take a while. You’ll need feedback from all corners, friends are good to start with but be sure to include your skeptics too. Your goal is to convince everyone that they want you to solve the problem. Yes, that means a lot more talking. If you’re tired now, maybe this isn’t your problem to solve!

 If this problem is with another team, and you talked to that team, brought them clear examples of why it is truly a big deal, and they haven’t answered your concerns to your satisfaction, you have a choice. Do you escalate to your manager? If you have clear examples of why it’s a problem, and your peer hasn’t been able to do anything, this is a perfectly fine time to escalate!

 Learning how to pick your battles is also about learning how to pick your company and pick your boss, because your job really shouldn’t be all or even mostly about battles. Going through this exercise of solving an unowned problem is fun once in a while, but it’s a real drag when you feel like you’re surrounded by such problems

The entrepreneurial gap comes in when you give people bigger accountability than they have the direct ability to execute against. This is in many ways the classic startup move.

. When you are in direct competition with your peers for scarce resources and you are not going to be graded on the same outcomes, the entrepreneurial gap produces a toxic environment of politics and power plays. Perhaps the best idea sometimes wins in these situations, but more often the best political players rule the day.

Organizational alignment is important because it lets you successfully ask more from people than the resources they have at hand. Without organizational alignment, you get political maneuvering. Without stretching people beyond their direct control, you get a lack of collaboration and creative cross-functional engagement.

Predict the questions that your boss tends to ask, and have some general answers prepared. That will give you some ammunition to use as you push back for time to get details on specific concerns. And you will need to push back occasionally. The worst outcome is having your boss go directly to the team themselves and ask for a status update.
The clearest indicators that you are managing (or being managed) by outputs are roadmaps that list a fixed set of features with release dates, Gantt charts that sequence the year’s projects, and annual budgeting cycles where you commit to funding specific projects.

Managers don’t trust that teams can reach outcomes on their own. Therefore, managers micromanage their teams’ outputs. As a result, teams don’t communicate their progress toward their outcomes. Which leads to managers continuing to mistrust their teams’ ability to reach those outcomes.

The most important feedback a leader can give their team is what outcomes they should be focused on. This should be a two-way negotiation between the leader and the team.

The leader should bring the across-the-business view of what the business needs at that moment in time. The team, if they are a true continuous discovery team, should be closest to the customer with a deep understanding of the technology, and should communicate how much progress can be made on what timeline.

So remember, if you want to break the vicious cycle of mistrust, first teach your teams how to show their work, then fix how you give feedback. Ask more questions and don’t fixate on the conclusions.

stay silent to see if the other side can pursue you

When the message is not clear, guess one direction and trial and error

* To trigger other people's bragging and make them feel good: time + scenario + slightly irritating/negative experience + positively peak as the end.
* Provide three options instead of yes/no questions, so that people is more likely to give valid info, espeically when under stress
* Reaction is immediate and visceral. It’s tied to our reptilian brains, and loaded with emotion. Response is more thoughtful and measured. It’s high-context, and actionable.

There is never enough time; you are greatly outnumbered by chaotic, beautiful snowflakes, and there is too much to do and too much to know. This is the status quo of management, and without a clear counter-investment in building, you are going to get lost in the busy.

Second, each week you need to carve off at least five hours to work on this big rock project with sessions no smaller than one hour. This is on your calendar protected time that you can’t reschedule. It’s as important as your 1:1s and your staff meeting. You are going to love this.

The value created isn’t just the small decrease in entropy, it’s that you are actively demonstrating being a leader. I understand the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small broken things.

Engineers have a well-deserved reputation for regularly being off by a factor of three in their work estimates, and that is partly due to the fact that we are really shitty at estimating the non-linear chaotic work (and fun) that exists in keeping a group of humans pointed in the right direction.

The simple act of listening to someone bitch is often all you need to do. It’s not what you should always do, but there are times when all that your people need to do is take the unorganized mess of feelings and thoughts in their heads, organize them, and express them out loud.

Understand that while facts, data, and conversation will eventually be helpful, in a trigger situation time is the only initial cure. There’s value in talking through the situation in the moment, but, again, faulty wiring. They’re furious — perhaps for valid reasons — and until the fury passes, it’s less a conversation than a very important vent.

Wait for Frank. It’s not always the best advice, but when I stumble on a trigger, I usually wait — sometimes a long time — for Frank to say something. In my mind, I’m watching him standing there, rubbing where he hit his head, shouting, “YOU KNOW THAT FUCKING HURT.” Too often I have jumped in with some helpful advice only to have it twisted and thrown back in my face because Frank was triggered.


At its core, bitching is personal… I feel… I think… You know what I think…? It’s personal and often intense observation of the world. It’s not casual conversation anymore because it suddenly has a sliver of emotion that was not previously there. This is the first step in bitch triage.

The simple act of listening to someone bitch is often all you need to do. It’s not what you should always do, but there are times when all that your people need to do is take the unorganized mess of feelings and thoughts in their heads, organize them, and express them out loud. This simple act of creation gives these people satisfaction. The thought is now real because it exists outside of their heads. Talking about it makes it real.

emember, bitching is not currently about you; it’s about this other person getting their sometimes unorganized thoughts out of their head, and doing so is an act of trust on their part. If each time they bitch you jump in and ask, “Should I act?” they’re going to think you’re more interested in blindly acting than listening.

Part of you might want to join in the bitching, especially if the topic is of particular interest to you, but don’t. Joining in the bitching might feel like the friendly natural course of action, but you’re not helping – you’re making it someone else’s problem. Joining in is amplification and amplification is just louder bitching.

The best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know what will happen next. If you do that every day when you are writing a novel, you will never be stuck
 in his own life, he was much more motivated to get back to tasks if he had left them when they were going well.

 Instead of just having a vision of the direction your work is heading in, they took the liberty of adding two more principles: people should feel that they are close to finishing the task, and it should be challenging enough so that you care if you complete it or not.

 When an interruption prevents individuals from achieving a particular goal or task, they make faster and less thoughtful decisions in completely unrelated areas

 To harness the effect properly, the interruption should be scheduled for when you feel like you know where you’re going with your work

 The idea is that by helping students to split up their work, the Hemingway effect will kick in as they approach the end of each section.

 I have a standing agenda item for all team meetings that reads “gossip, rumors, and lies” and when we hit that agenda item, it’s a chance for everyone on the team to figure out what is the truth and what is a lie

 After that’s done, my next measure of a team meeting is: did we make tangible progress on something? I don’t know what you build, so I don’t know what’s broken on your team, but I do know that something is broken and a team meeting is a great place to not only identify the brokenness, but also to start to discuss how to fix it.

 Bullshit. The presence of rigid, email-based status reports comes down to control, a lack of imagination, and a lack of trust in the organization.

Well, what I really want is your high level assessment of the week. Three things that are working, three things that aren’t, and what we’re going to do about it. Ok, now we’re talking. I can do a strategic assessment of the week, but why don’t we just put that at the beginning of the 1:1? That way when you have questions (and you will), we can have a big fat debate.

Status reports usually show up because a distant executive feels out of touch with part of his or her organization and they believe getting everyone to efficiently document their week is going to help. It doesn’t. Emailed status reports say one thing to 90% of the people who wrote them: “You don’t value my time”. This leads us to our next point…

Move #1 – Three Prepared Points: While I believe part of a good organic 1:1 is improvisation, I usually have three talking points in my back pocket that have shown up over the past week regarding you or your team. If we can’t find a good thread of conversation in the first 10-15 minutes, I’ll start with one of these points and see where that takes us.

It won’t be your actual performance review; it’s one aspect of your review that somehow strikes me as more appropriate conversation

The point of this discussion is not to solve my Disaster, the point is that we’re going to have a conversation where one of us is going to learn something more than just project status.

A productive 1:1 is one where we talk strategically about how we do stuff, but, more importantly, how we might do this stuff better.

When the Vent begins, you might confuse this for a conversation. It’s not. It’s a Vent. It’s a mental release valve and your job is to listen for as long as it takes. Don’t problem solve. Don’t redirect. Don’t comfort. Yet. Your employee is doing mental house cleaning and interrupting this cleaning is missing the point. They don’t want a solution, they want to be heard.

#1 It’s Done. The Vent starts to lose steam and the Venter finds themselves panting and staring at you with nothing to say because they’ve said it all — probably a couple of times. It’s in this moment that you begin your triage. Great, now we start talking…

When the Disaster arrives, the absolute worst response is any semblance of emotion. See, they want to fight. They literally want to go a couple of rounds on this particular topic. What was a high degree of frustration has transformed into pure aggression and if you so much as blink improperly, you’re contributing to the escalation of this situation

Shut up. Really. Your primary job during the Disaster is to defuse, and you start defusing by contributing absolutely nothing. If you’re a logical, reasonable management type, you’ll be tempted to ask clarifying questions — to try to shape the problem.

The sound that surrounds successful regimen of 1:1s is silence.
