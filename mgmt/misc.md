structured procastination - work on something important but not urgent!

That sounds like how all my best managers have worked, whether on site or remote. Their job is to facilitate your work, not control it.

“International team” where expectation and default cultural bias are major issues.

Wait for problems before you introduce solutions (esp. processes or infrastructure)

You really want to be attached to Profit Centers because it will bring you higher wages, more respect, and greater opportunities for everything of value to you

if you are checking your phone couple of seconds, it is a sign you are tired, fatigued

Remember, part of your job now is to define what work needs to be done. Your boss won't always be able to tell you what to do, and she probably expects you to tell her what needs to be done. Use this time to answer that question.

Don’t go bringing problems based on people from other teams complaining to you. Those teams need to bring up the problems themselves. If you must, tell their manager that you’re hearing these complaints, and let that manager decide whether to deal with it.

 Expect this feedback, buy-in, and revision process to take a while. You’ll need feedback from all corners, friends are good to start with but be sure to include your skeptics too. Your goal is to convince everyone that they want you to solve the problem. Yes, that means a lot more talking. If you’re tired now, maybe this isn’t your problem to solve!

 If this problem is with another team, and you talked to that team, brought them clear examples of why it is truly a big deal, and they haven’t answered your concerns to your satisfaction, you have a choice. Do you escalate to your manager? If you have clear examples of why it’s a problem, and your peer hasn’t been able to do anything, this is a perfectly fine time to escalate!

 Learning how to pick your battles is also about learning how to pick your company and pick your boss, because your job really shouldn’t be all or even mostly about battles. Going through this exercise of solving an unowned problem is fun once in a while, but it’s a real drag when you feel like you’re surrounded by such problems

The entrepreneurial gap comes in when you give people bigger accountability than they have the direct ability to execute against. This is in many ways the classic startup move.

. When you are in direct competition with your peers for scarce resources and you are not going to be graded on the same outcomes, the entrepreneurial gap produces a toxic environment of politics and power plays. Perhaps the best idea sometimes wins in these situations, but more often the best political players rule the day.

Organizational alignment is important because it lets you successfully ask more from people than the resources they have at hand. Without organizational alignment, you get political maneuvering. Without stretching people beyond their direct control, you get a lack of collaboration and creative cross-functional engagement.

Predict the questions that your boss tends to ask, and have some general answers prepared. That will give you some ammunition to use as you push back for time to get details on specific concerns. And you will need to push back occasionally. The worst outcome is having your boss go directly to the team themselves and ask for a status update.
The clearest indicators that you are managing (or being managed) by outputs are roadmaps that list a fixed set of features with release dates, Gantt charts that sequence the year’s projects, and annual budgeting cycles where you commit to funding specific projects.

Managers don’t trust that teams can reach outcomes on their own. Therefore, managers micromanage their teams’ outputs. As a result, teams don’t communicate their progress toward their outcomes. Which leads to managers continuing to mistrust their teams’ ability to reach those outcomes.

The most important feedback a leader can give their team is what outcomes they should be focused on. This should be a two-way negotiation between the leader and the team.

The leader should bring the across-the-business view of what the business needs at that moment in time. The team, if they are a true continuous discovery team, should be closest to the customer with a deep understanding of the technology, and should communicate how much progress can be made on what timeline.

So remember, if you want to break the vicious cycle of mistrust, first teach your teams how to show their work, then fix how you give feedback. Ask more questions and don’t fixate on the conclusions.

stay silent to see if the other side can pursue you

When the message is not clear, guess one direction and trial and error

* To trigger other people's bragging and make them feel good: time + scenario + slightly irritating/negative experience + positively peak as the end.
* Provide three options instead of yes/no questions, so that people is more likely to give valid info, espeically when under stress
* Reaction is immediate and visceral. It’s tied to our reptilian brains, and loaded with emotion. Response is more thoughtful and measured. It’s high-context, and actionable.
