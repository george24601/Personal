You really want to be attached to Profit Centers because it will bring you higher wages, more respect, and greater opportunities for everything of value to you

if you are checking your phone couple of seconds, it is a sign you are tired, fatigued

Don’t go bringing problems based on people from other teams complaining to you. Those teams need to bring up the problems themselves. If you must, tell their manager that you’re hearing these complaints, and let that manager decide whether to deal with it.

 Expect this feedback, buy-in, and revision process to take a while. You’ll need feedback from all corners, friends are good to start with but be sure to include your skeptics too. Your goal is to convince everyone that they want you to solve the problem. Yes, that means a lot more talking. If you’re tired now, maybe this isn’t your problem to solve!

 If this problem is with another team, and you talked to that team, brought them clear examples of why it is truly a big deal, and they haven’t answered your concerns to your satisfaction, you have a choice. Do you escalate to your manager? If you have clear examples of why it’s a problem, and your peer hasn’t been able to do anything, this is a perfectly fine time to escalate!

 Learning how to pick your battles is also about learning how to pick your company and pick your boss, because your job really shouldn’t be all or even mostly about battles. Going through this exercise of solving an unowned problem is fun once in a while, but it’s a real drag when you feel like you’re surrounded by such problems

The entrepreneurial gap comes in when you give people bigger accountability than they have the direct ability to execute against. This is in many ways the classic startup move.

. When you are in direct competition with your peers for scarce resources and you are not going to be graded on the same outcomes, the entrepreneurial gap produces a toxic environment of politics and power plays. Perhaps the best idea sometimes wins in these situations, but more often the best political players rule the day.

Organizational alignment is important because it lets you successfully ask more from people than the resources they have at hand. Without organizational alignment, you get political maneuvering. Without stretching people beyond their direct control, you get a lack of collaboration and creative cross-functional engagement.

So, instinct and guesses are necessary. But we needn't lose our analytical approach just because we don't have data. When you build something, you have a hypothesis about the person you are building it for. You have a guess as to what they will like, and most of the time you have a reason for that guess. When you're trying to build a business, you need a chain of events that you expect could happen that would indicate a product is successful. You have a sense of what to start measuring once the thing is released that will show whether it is working.

Predict the questions that your boss tends to ask, and have some general answers prepared. That will give you some ammunition to use as you push back for time to get details on specific concerns. And you will need to push back occasionally. The worst outcome is having your boss go directly to the team themselves and ask for a status update.
The clearest indicators that you are managing (or being managed) by outputs are roadmaps that list a fixed set of features with release dates, Gantt charts that sequence the year’s projects, and annual budgeting cycles where you commit to funding specific projects.

An outcome is typically defined by a quantitative metric—a number that is both meaningful to the business and measurable by the team. It creates autonomy and accountability.

In neither case should this inch toward defining specific actions—features, projects, or initiatives—that must be done to reach those outcomes.

We assign quarterly OKRs and then we either dictate a fixed roadmap or we ask the team to commit to a fixed roadmap.

We spend all of our time discussing actions and only talk about outcomes during the one or two weeks we spend defining what outcomes to set next.

We are still managing by outputs with some outcome language sprinkled around the edges.

This is often easier said than done. Defining the right metric is challenging in and of itself, let alone setting up the infrastructure to measure that metric reliably and accurately.

This is one of the reasons why OKRs have become so popular. By defining both a qualitative objective and one or more quantitative key results, OKRs allow us to take multiple iterations to define the correct metric without changing the overarching objective.

Managers don’t trust that teams can reach outcomes on their own. Therefore, managers micromanage their teams’ outputs. As a result, teams don’t communicate their progress toward their outcomes. Which leads to managers continuing to mistrust their teams’ ability to reach those outcomes.

Most teams communicate progress by communicating outputs. We talk about what’s in the next sprint. We share 12-month roadmaps. We talk through project plans.

The most important feedback a leader can give their team is what outcomes they should be focused on. This should be a two-way negotiation between the leader and the team.

The leader should bring the across-the-business view of what the business needs at that moment in time. The team, if they are a true continuous discovery team, should be closest to the customer with a deep understanding of the technology, and should communicate how much progress can be made on what timeline.

So remember, if you want to break the vicious cycle of mistrust, first teach your teams how to show their work, then fix how you give feedback. Ask more questions and don’t fixate on the conclusions.

### oral

* To trigger other people's bragging and make them feel good: time + scenario + slightly irritating/negative experience + positively peak as the end.
* Instead of use "talk", "speak" seems to work, e.g., "I wanna come down and I wanna speak to you…"
* Use "something" instead of "anything", e.g., "Is there something else you want to address in the visit today?"
* Provide three options instead of yes/no questions, so that people is more likely to give valid info, espeically when under stress
* Find a way to reply with equal or more amount of information to keep conversation going
* Reaction is immediate and visceral. It’s tied to our reptilian brains, and loaded with emotion. Response is more thoughtful and measured. It’s high-context, and actionable.
