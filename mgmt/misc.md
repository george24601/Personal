You really want to be attached to Profit Centers because it will bring you higher wages, more respect, and greater opportunities for everything of value to you

The entrepreneurial gap comes in when you give people bigger accountability than they have the direct ability to execute against. This is in many ways the classic startup move.

The worst outcome is having your boss go directly to the team themselves and ask for a status update.

The clearest indicators that you are managing (or being managed) by outputs are roadmaps that list a fixed set of features with release dates, Gantt charts that sequence the year’s projects, and annual budgeting cycles where you commit to funding specific projects.

 To trigger other people's bragging and make them feel good: time + scenario + slightly irritating/negative experience + positively peak as the end.

Provide three options instead of yes/no questions, so that people is more likely to give valid info, espeically when under stress

Reaction is immediate and visceral. It’s tied to our reptilian brains, and loaded with emotion. Response is more thoughtful and measured. It’s high-context, and actionable.

Engineers have a well-deserved reputation for regularly being off by a factor of three in their work estimates, and that is partly due to the fact that we are really shitty at estimating the non-linear chaotic work (and fun) that exists in keeping a group of humans pointed in the right direction.

I have a standing agenda item for all team meetings that reads “gossip, rumors, and lies” and when we hit that agenda item, it’s a chance for everyone on the team to figure out what is the truth and what is a lie

After that’s done, my next measure of a team meeting is: did we make tangible progress on something? I don’t know what you build, so I don’t know what’s broken on your team, but I do know that something is broken and a team meeting is a great place to not only identify the brokenness, but also to start to discuss how to fix it.

1. Brief the interpreter in advance about the subject and give him a copy of the presentation to study and discuss.

2. Speak loudly, clearly, and slowly. (Some Americans try to talk with a cigar in the mouth—an egregious mistake.)

3. Avoid little-known words, such as “arcane,” “heuristic,” or “buncombe.”

4. Maintain a pleasant attitude.

5. Explain each major idea in two or three different ways, as the point may be lost if discussed only once.
6. Do not talk more than a minute or two without giving the interpreter a chance to speak.

7. While talking, allow the interpreter time to make notes of what is being said.

8. Assume that all numbers over 10,000 may be mistranslated. Repeat them carefully and write them down for all to see. The Japanese system of counting large sums is so different from those of the West that errors frequently occur. Also, the number billion should be avoided, as it means 1,000,000,000,000 in Europe, and 1,000,000,000 in the United States.

9. Do not lose confidence if the interpreter uses a dictionary. No one is likely to have a vocabulary of 40,000 words in each of two languages, and a dictionary is often essential.

10. Permit the interpreter to spend as much time as needed in clarifying points whose meanings are obscure.

11. Do not interrupt the interpreter as he translates. Interrupting causes many misunderstandings, usually leaves the visitor from overseas only half informed, and gives the Japanese side a feeling that the foreigner is too impatient to be competent.

12. Do not jump to conclusions, as Japanese ways of doing things are often different from what foreigners expect.

13. Avoid long sentences, double negatives, or the use of negative wordings of a sentence when a positive form could be used.
14. Don’t use slang terms, as, for example, “If you will let me have half a ‘G’ at six bits apiece, it’ll be gung ho with me.” Rather, state simply, “I want 500 at 75¢ each.”

15. Avoid superfluous words. Your point may be lost if wrapped up in generalities.

16. Try to be as expressive as possible by using movements of hands, eyes, lips, shoulders, and head to supplement words.

17. During meetings, write out the main points discussed; in this way both parties can double check their understanding.

18. After meetings, confirm in writing what has been agreed to.

19. Don’t expect an interpreter to work for over an hour or two without a rest period. His work is exhausting and a nervous strain.

20. Consider using two men if interpreting is to last a whole day or into the evening, so that when one tires the other can take over.

21. Don’t be suspicious if a speaker talks for five minutes and the interpreter covers it in half a minute. The speaker may have been wordy.
22. Be understanding if it develops that the interpreter has made a mistake. It is almost impossible to avoid making some errors, because Japanese and European languages are so dissimilar.

23. Be sure the Japanese are given all the time they want to tell their side of the story. If they hesitate, ask the interpreter for advice on what next to say or do.
