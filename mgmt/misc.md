Elicit Value??

Many people confuse leverage and efficiency. They are different. Efficiency is fixing a desired output and minimizing the effort to achieve it. We are not an efficiency company.

We are a leverage company. For a fixed amount of effort, how can you maximize your impact? This question is your guiding light. In everything you do, figure out how to multiply the impact you have by 10x.
Never confuse efficiency and leverage. Efficiency is what lazy people aspire to. Leverage is what we do.

Some meetings are to transfer information, some to allow discussion and some to reach a decision or resolve a problem. There are committee meetings that exist to satisfy some rule or regulation. I am on such a committee, and find it useful as a reminder not to sign up for any other committees. 

But nothing undermines a meeting more than a lack of agreement as to why it’s happening

In brainstorming, individuals distract each other, groups fixate on particular topics and some people use the opportunity to stop thinking entirely. Twelve people generate more ideas if they work separately than if they brainstorm together.

The meeting serves a far more important creative purpose when it is time to criticise, evaluate and combine those ideas.

groups come up with more ideas — and, importantly, better ideas — when they are invited to debate and dissent. It may even be worth breaking the meeting into subgroups with the express purpose of developing competing ideas. “Do not criticise” is a handy rule for new grandparents; it’s not a good approach for innovators.

a clear common thread: people come prepared, have a reason to work together and finish the meeting with a clear sense of what comes next. A good meeting is a good meeting less because of what happens at the time, but because of what came before — and most importantly, what comes after.
