 If you want to be able to find interesting work and also work on important things, you generally have to go find the interesting important things yourself. This requires that you to talk to a lot of people and listen to their problems, and then place a bet on a solution to one of these problems that will actually both be feasible but will also be seen as important. Your manager might help identify people that you could talk to, but you must take responsibility for doing the legwork and making the final choice in problems to address.

Authority care most what you can contribute in the future

To affect opinions of people, not only the person himself, but also whoever that can directly affect the said person too. Build common interest between the people around the authority

Easier to build new relationship than saving old relationship

a critical feature of effective complex organisations is that they make people do all the jobs.

Training is the highest leverage activity a manager can do to increase the output of an organization.  Don’t leave training to outsiders, do it yourself.

NEVER complain your company or your team's task in front your subordinates - and stop the complaints at you! However, it is OK to complain to your boss! 

We change by parcticing a different behavior, that, over time, leads us to think about things differently

When you’re new, this is when you are at your most vulnerable. This is because you want to make sense of your environment so you can start being an effective leader.

They take pride in being human shields, absorbing or deflecting heat from inside and outside the company, doing all manner of boring and silly tasks, and battling idiots and slights that make life harder than necessary on their people.

they found that people with a mentor to help develop them were much more likely to stick around

It’s the job of every manager to help with the flow of information up and down the organization. When people express frustration with leadership, like in the survey above, it’s usually due to a failure in that flow.

Your people are hungry to know how they’re doing. As a manager, you’re best positioned to provide that feedback.

Unfortunately, many companies have over-invested in hygiene factors. High pay, tons of perks, and over-investment in superficial aspects of “company culture” represent the wrong end of the 80-20 rule for impacting the motivation of your people.

Perks can be expensive, but they’re easy. Once you add a perk, it just continues to be a line item on your budget. There’s little you have to think about.

Meanwhile, Motivators are inexpensive, but time-consuming

The next time you think about adding a perk, challenge yourself how beneficial it will really be for your company. Avoid the trap of choosing perks rather than the hard work of improving your managers.

You have to care deeply about your people, but not what they think of you

The way many companies structure their real-time feedback approach is geared towards reaction as opposed to response.

Reaction is immediate and visceral. It’s tied to our reptilian brains, and loaded with emotion. Response is more thoughtful and measured. It’s high-context, and actionable.

Also, while for the most severe issues immediate response is necessary, in most cases a conversation with context and background would be more effective.

Training programs don’t necessarily need to be expensive, formalized events, but they do need to be intentional.

Talk about great managers as your company's No. 1 benefit.

Most companies design jobs and then slot people into them. Our best managers sometimes do the opposite: When they find talented people, they’re open to creating jobs around them.

The best go out of their way to help people do work they enjoy — even if it means rotating them out of roles where they’re excelling.

 In the first week on the job, managers sit down with their new hires and ask them about their favorite projects they’ve done, the moments when they’ve felt most energized at work, the times when they’ve found themselves totally immersed in a state of flow, and the passions they have outside their jobs. Armed with that knowledge, managers can build engaging roles from the start.

As managers learn who knows what, they can connect the dots — or better yet, build a searchable database of experts. The goal is to put employees’ strengths on display so that people know whom to contact.

Companies that teach the most get the best people.

Have strong onboarding documents and employee handbooks

Have new employees improve those onboarding documents

Focusing on people is arguably the highest leverage activity to spend time on as CEO, since great people build great products, which leads to great profits (in that order)

It’s ok, and even desirable to have products with some overlap. Each pushes the other to be better with friendly competition

It’s easier to hire 90th percentile performers who start doing great work right away, than to train average performers into 90th percentile performers

People refer friends because it’s a great place to work, not (primarily) for the referral bonus.

Manager quality is the single best predictor of whether an employee will stay or leave. Good managers also cause their reports to have higher performance scores.

In training, spend more time on practice/repetition, and less on content
The tough part is getting people to put what they know into practice.

Have the best employees in each area run trainings
Favor internal people over external people for trainings.

Non cash rewards, whether they are experiences (dinner for two, a trip) or gifts (a new phone) trigger an emotional response. When people are surveyed they say they prefer cash awards, but they report higher levels of happiness when receiving experiential awards.

Here are some narratives that might keep developers around:

“If you implement feature X on or ahead of schedule, we will promote you.”
“With the work that we’re giving you over the next few months, you’re going to become the foremost NoSQL expert in our organization.”
“We recognize that you have a lot of respect for Bob’s Ruby work, so we’re putting you on a project with him to serve as your mentor so that you can learn from him and get to his level.”
“We’re building an accounting package that’s critical to our business, and you are going to be solely responsible for the security and logging portions of it.”
“If your work on project Y keeps going well, we’re going to allow you to choose your next assignment based on which language you’re most interested in using/learning.”

A new team member who says, “I want to be the department’s principal architect” may have his head in the clouds a bit, but you might be able to find a small, one-man project and say, “start by architecting this and we’ll take it from there.”

Humans are wired for teamwork, and the possibility of contributing to the creation of something larger in cooperation with others can, in itself, create an engaging workplace.

So work to create the feeling of teamwork, in such a way that everyone feels they’re working together and contributing to the whole. This will increase the attachment that your team feels to their work, and their working environment.

Rather than just look at how to engage employees, it’s also helpful to look at how to lose them, and do the opposite.

Let them experiment. Let them obsess. Let them scratch that itch. If there is no project on their plate that you know is engaging them, create time for them to explore whatever they want to obsess about. I absolutely guarantee there is an investigation somehow related to their work that they are dying to tinker with. The business justification for this wild-ass effort is likely not obvious, so I’ll define it: the act of exploration is as valuable as the act of building.
Exploration is hard to justify because it’s hard to measure. When exploration is complete, you often have nothing to hold up to your project manager to explain or justify the expenditure of time. Here’s what you tell them, “My job isn’t just building product; I also build people.”

a daily set of distractions courtesy of exhausting people will pull your engineer away from their work. Random meetings, phone calls, interviews. These 30- to 60-minute tasks feel transactional and brief and there is no way you can fully remove a team member from them, but you manage them. Similar to crap work, it’s your job to evenly spread the load of daily noise across the team. More importantly, it’s your job to remember that productivity costs surrounding these micro-tasks aren’t just the 30 minutes necessary to get them done, it’s the context-switching tax involved in stopping their work, preparing for the task, doing the task, and then rebuilding the context regarding the work that floats their boat.

### remote team

In remote teams, you need to set up in a way people can be as autonomously as they need. Autonomously doesn’t mean “left alone” it means “be able to run alone” (when needed).

You need to act like a larger company than you actually are. you need to be stricter about best practices, and you will run into communication problems… a lot of them.

Similarly problematic are satellite offices. The bridge between the offices has 5x communication needs, but people in each office act like co-located teams. Unless the offices can work mostly autonomously, this communication bridge between them will suffer.

If you need a small office, make sure people in it don’t have a critical mass in projects and communicate remote-friendly.

So the first thing you have to do, before giving them books, is to really convince them that they need to change.

First, praise people as soon as possible after observing the desired behavior
Second, be specific. Tell the person what you liked. Don't wait for the perfect performances
Feedback cycle needs to be quick!!!

Stress is stress, fatigue on one task spills over into another

we need to be mindful that what is going on in our players’ minds, and in their personal lives away from the training ground, plays a huge part in what we get from them on a day-to-day basis
