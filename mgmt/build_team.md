Authority care most what you can contribute in the future

To affect opinions of people, not only the person himself, but also whoever that can directly affect the said person too. Build common interest between the people around the authority

Easier to build new relationship than saving old relationship

When you’re new, this is when you are at your most vulnerable. This is because you want to make sense of your environment so you can start being an effective leader.

They take pride in being human shields, absorbing or deflecting heat from inside and outside the company, doing all manner of boring and silly tasks, and battling idiots and slights that make life harder than necessary on their people.

You have to care deeply about your people, but not what they think of you

Have strong onboarding documents and employee handbooks

Have new employees improve those onboarding documents

It’s ok, and even desirable to have products with some overlap. Each pushes the other to be better with friendly competition

In remote teams, you need to set up in a way people can be as autonomously as they need. Autonomously doesn’t mean “left alone” it means “be able to run alone” (when needed).

In a remote team You need to act like a larger company than you actually are. you need to be stricter about best practices, and you will run into communication problems… a lot of them.

Similarly problematic are satellite offices. The bridge between the offices has 5x communication needs, but people in each office act like co-located teams. Unless the offices can work mostly autonomously, this communication bridge between them will suffer.

If you need a small office, make sure people in it don’t have a critical mass in projects and communicate remote-friendly.
