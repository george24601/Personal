Authority care most what you can contribute in the future

Easier to build new relationship than saving old relationship

When you’re new, this is when you are at your most vulnerable. This is because you want to make sense of your environment so you can start being an effective leader.

You have to care deeply about your people, but not what they think of you

Have strong onboarding documents and employee handbooks. Have new employees improve those onboarding documents

It’s ok, and even desirable to have products with some overlap. Each pushes the other to be better with friendly competition

 It’s your responsibility, therefore, to get your team on the same page: Get used to repeating yourself, and drop the passive-aggressive “as I said last week” and “per my last email.” Research shows that neutral tones come across as negative, and positive tones as neutral. Overcorrect with emoji, GIFs, and explicit communication. Sarcasm and irony are big gambles—our advice is to skip them. 

 At a certain point your learning will plateau, and this is when the second type of work kicks in: executing. This is the act of applying that knowledge to get the job done and create leverage. Eventually, you will create enough leverage to automate the job or grow out of it, and this is when you start the cycle over. Learn. Execute.

Meetings are a privilege, but the privilege isn’t that you get to go, the privilege is that you get to go to represent your team. This means you show up informed and capable of representing their interests and when the meeting is over that you deftly and capably communicate the results of the meeting to your team.

 Values are principles or standards of behavior, and in a group of humans, they are first defined by the founding employees and then evolved over time by the leadership team. Painting them on the walls or writing them down in an employee handbook makes them accessible and obvious, but it is how these values are consistently applied especially during times of crisis that gives values value.

For every open job on your team, you need to spend one hour a day on recruiting-related activities. Cap that investment at 50% of your time. 

The value created isn’t just the small decrease in entropy, it’s that you are actively demonstrating being a leader. I understand the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small broken things.

If team members are feeling overwhelmed then you've gone too far. Don't throw your intern to the sharks
