NEVER complain your company or your team's task in front your subordinates - and stop the complaints at you! However, it is OK to complain to your boss! 

When you’re new, this is when you are at your most vulnerable. This is because you want to make sense of your environment so you can start being an effective leader.

They take pride in being human shields, absorbing or deflecting heat from inside and outside the company, doing all manner of boring and silly tasks, and battling idiots and slights that make life harder than necessary on their people.

It’s the job of every manager to help with the flow of information up and down the organization. When people express frustration with leadership, like in the survey above, it’s usually due to a failure in that flow.

Your people are hungry to know how they’re doing. As a manager, you’re best positioned to provide that feedback.


You have to care deeply about your people, but not what they think of you

Reaction is immediate and visceral. It’s tied to our reptilian brains, and loaded with emotion. Response is more thoughtful and measured. It’s high-context, and actionable.

Also, while for the most severe issues immediate response is necessary, in most cases a conversation with context and background would be more effective.

Have strong onboarding documents and employee handbooks

Have new employees improve those onboarding documents

It’s ok, and even desirable to have products with some overlap. Each pushes the other to be better with friendly competition


A new team member who says, “I want to be the department’s principal architect” may have his head in the clouds a bit, but you might be able to find a small, one-man project and say, “start by architecting this and we’ll take it from there.”

In remote teams, you need to set up in a way people can be as autonomously as they need. Autonomously doesn’t mean “left alone” it means “be able to run alone” (when needed).

In a remote team You need to act like a larger company than you actually are. you need to be stricter about best practices, and you will run into communication problems… a lot of them.

Similarly problematic are satellite offices. The bridge between the offices has 5x communication needs, but people in each office act like co-located teams. Unless the offices can work mostly autonomously, this communication bridge between them will suffer.

If you need a small office, make sure people in it don’t have a critical mass in projects and communicate remote-friendly.
