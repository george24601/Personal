Authority care most what you can contribute in the future

To affect opinions of people, not only the person himself, but also whoever that can directly affect the said person too. Build common interest between the people around the authority

Easier to build new relationship than saving old relationship

Can be a leader or follower regardless of current status and self-esteem

a critical feature of effective complex organisations is that they make people do all the jobs.

Training is the highest leverage activity a manager can do to increase the output of an organization.  Don’t leave training to outsiders, do it yourself.

never complain your company or your team's task in front your subordinates - and stop the complaints at you! However, it is OK to complain to your boss! 

HR should work with front-line managers to monitor the level of demands they’re placing on people, as well as the balance between demands and resources. The higher the work demands, the higher employees’ need for support, acknowledgement, or opportunities for recovery.

when commenting, compare with the same person's previous product, to cushion the shocks

“Instead of 150 new people, are you sure you don’t want 75 people whom you pay twice as much because they have twice as much experience and can be higher performers?”
We change by parcticing a different behavior, that, over time, leads us to think about things differently

When you’re new, this is when you are at your most vulnerable. This is because you want to make sense of your environment so you can start being an effective leader.

They take pride in being human shields, absorbing or deflecting heat from inside and outside the company, doing all manner of boring and silly tasks, and battling idiots and slights that make life harder than necessary on their people.

The best bosses orchestrate constructive battles—enabling people to feel safe to speak their minds, even to the leader.

The team members clashed with one another—but these were good fights, built on mutual trust. Indeed, Bird tells his teams, “I want you guys to speak up and drop your drawers. We’re going to look at your scenes in front of everybody. Everyone will get humiliated and encouraged together.”

 If you are a boss, protecting yourself from intrusions may be a lost cause, particularly in the era of e-mail, RSS feeds, and Twitter. But you can run interference for employees, especially those whose work requires concentration, such as engineers, lawyers, nurses, writers, and other knowledge workers.

  But sometimes good bosses face senior leaders and powerful groups that cram bad ideas down everyone’s throat. When your people’s performance or well-being is threatened by idiocy from on high, you need to decide whether to comply or resist, depending on what will help them—and you—most. Sometimes the political costs of defiance are too high, and sometimes seemingly idiotic directives turn out to be useful.

Covering for employees can be painful and risky for a boss, but it can be remarkably effective. It engenders loyalty by demonstrating that you aren’t just spewing out hollow rhetoric about trying to protect them.

it’s important for managers to sit down with their team members and lay out a path for growth.  One on ones are a perfect time to do this, and ensure there’s a time for follow up much sooner than the next review cycle.

they found that people with a mentor to help develop them were much more likely to stick around

When communication breaks down somewhere in the leadership hierarchy, everyone suffers. This is when people feel out of the loop. It’s also when they get frustrated by putting their efforts into work that doesn’t matter.

It’s the job of every manager to help with the flow of information up and down the organization. When people express frustration with leadership, like in the survey above, it’s usually due to a failure in that flow.

Leaders also have a huge impact on the ranks below them. If a leader is disengaged or unhappy, the managers under them are likely to be as well.

Your people are hungry to know how they’re doing. As a manager, you’re best positioned to provide that feedback.

Unfortunately, many companies have over-invested in hygiene factors. High pay, tons of perks, and over-investment in superficial aspects of “company culture” represent the wrong end of the 80-20 rule for impacting the motivation of your people.

Perks can be expensive, but they’re easy. Once you add a perk, it just continues to be a line item on your budget. There’s little you have to think about.

Meanwhile, Motivators are inexpensive, but time-consuming

The next time you think about adding a perk, challenge yourself how beneficial it will really be for your company. Avoid the trap of choosing perks rather than the hard work of improving your managers.

You have to care deeply about your people, but not what they think of you

The way many companies structure their real-time feedback approach is geared towards reaction as opposed to response.

Reaction is immediate and visceral. It’s tied to our reptilian brains, and loaded with emotion.

Response is more thoughtful and measured. It’s high-context, and actionable.

Also, while for the most severe issues immediate response is necessary, in most cases a conversation with context and background would be more effective.

Training programs don’t necessarily need to be expensive, formalized events, but they do need to be intentional.

Talk about great managers as your company's No. 1 benefit.

Most companies design jobs and then slot people into them. Our best managers sometimes do the opposite: When they find talented people, they’re open to creating jobs around them.

The best go out of their way to help people do work they enjoy — even if it means rotating them out of roles where they’re excelling.

 In the first week on the job, managers sit down with their new hires and ask them about their favorite projects they’ve done, the moments when they’ve felt most energized at work, the times when they’ve found themselves totally immersed in a state of flow, and the passions they have outside their jobs. Armed with that knowledge, managers can build engaging roles from the start.

As managers learn who knows what, they can connect the dots — or better yet, build a searchable database of experts. The goal is to put employees’ strengths on display so that people know whom to contact.

The best people are recruited, not bought. The companies who pay top-of-market will always win the salary-optimizing people. The best people optimize to learn (remember Learn vs Earn?). Winning and retaining those people means creating an environment where people are willing to trade short-term compensation for long-term career capital. Many companies think paying the most gets them the best people. They are wrong. Companies that teach the most get the best people.

Have strong onboarding documents and employee handbooks

Have new employees improve those onboarding documents

Focusing on people is arguably the highest leverage activity to spend time on as CEO, since great people build great products, which leads to great profits (in that order)

It’s ok, and even desirable to have products with some overlap. Each pushes the other to be better with friendly competition

It’s easier to hire 90th percentile performers who start doing great work right away, than to train average performers into 90th percentile performers

People refer friends because it’s a great place to work, not (primarily) for the referral bonus.

Be more like an all-star team than a family. All star teams pay to recruit the best players. Players who don’t contribute or work as a team get cut.

People Ops should communicate in detail how decisions are made on hiring, promotions, comp, terminations, etc, but not reveal the details of any individual’s situation to respect their privacy.

Manager quality is the single best predictor of whether an employee will stay or leave. Good managers also cause their reports to have higher performance scores.

In training, spend more time on practice/repetition, and less on content
The tough part is getting people to put what they know into practice.

Have the best employees in each area run trainings
Favor internal people over external people for trainings.

Non cash rewards, whether they are experiences (dinner for two, a trip) or gifts (a new phone) trigger an emotional response. When people are surveyed they say they prefer cash awards, but they report higher levels of happiness when receiving experiential awards.

I think of boredom as a clock. Every second that someone on my team is bored, a second passes on this clock. After some aggregated amount of seconds that varies for every person, they look at the time, throw up their arms, and quit.

 Here are some narratives that might keep developers around:

“If you implement feature X on or ahead of schedule, we will promote you.”
“With the work that we’re giving you over the next few months, you’re going to become the foremost NoSQL expert in our organization.”
“We recognize that you have a lot of respect for Bob’s Ruby work, so we’re putting you on a project with him to serve as your mentor so that you can learn from him and get to his level.”
“We’re building an accounting package that’s critical to our business, and you are going to be solely responsible for the security and logging portions of it.”
“If your work on project Y keeps going well, we’re going to allow you to choose your next assignment based on which language you’re most interested in using/learning.”

A new team member who says, “I want to be the department’s principal architect” may have his head in the clouds a bit, but you might be able to find a small, one-man project and say, “start by architecting this and we’ll take it from there.”

Humans are wired for teamwork, and the possibility of contributing to the creation of something larger in cooperation with others can, in itself, create an engaging workplace.

So work to create the feeling of teamwork, in such a way that everyone feels they’re working together and contributing to the whole. This will increase the attachment that your team feels to their work, and their working environment.

 we, as leaders, are here — first and foremost — to serve our organizations. This may sound obvious, or even inevitable, but in our experience, it’s neither. In more traditional organizations, the service ethic flows in the opposite direction; that is, the organization is set up to serve its leaders, not the other way around.

To live Servant Leadership effectively; we start with the view that we are going to treat our staff as our “customers.”

Rather than just look at how to engage employees, it’s also helpful to look at how to lose them, and do the opposite.

when someone quits they are effectively saying, “I no longer believe in this company”. What’s worse is that what they were originally thinking was, “I’m bored”.

You ask, “Are you bored?” Even if you don’t have a gut feeling, it’s a good question to randomly ask your team. When I ask, I look you straight in the eyes and if you can’t stare me in the face and answer, I’m going to keep digging until you look me in the eye. Remember, the goal here is to discover boredom before they know it, and the act of a simple question might be just the mental impetus they need to see the early signs in themselves.

They’ll tell you halfway through your 1:1 and they won’t use the word bored. They’ll say something innocuous like, “…and I really don’t know what to do next,” and you’re going to blow right by the most important thing they’ve said in a while because you’re worried about your next meeting.

Let them experiment. Let them obsess. Let them scratch that itch. If there is no project on their plate that you know is engaging them, create time for them to explore whatever they want to obsess about. I absolutely guarantee there is an investigation somehow related to their work that they are dying to tinker with. The business justification for this wild-ass effort is likely not obvious, so I’ll define it: the act of exploration is as valuable as the act of building.
Exploration is hard to justify because it’s hard to measure. When exploration is complete, you often have nothing to hold up to your project manager to explain or justify the expenditure of time. Here’s what you tell them, “My job isn’t just building product; I also build people.”

a daily set of distractions courtesy of exhausting people will pull your engineer away from their work. Random meetings, phone calls, interviews. These 30- to 60-minute tasks feel transactional and brief and there is no way you can fully remove a team member from them, but you manage them. Similar to crap work, it’s your job to evenly spread the load of daily noise across the team. More importantly, it’s your job to remember that productivity costs surrounding these micro-tasks aren’t just the 30 minutes necessary to get them done, it’s the context-switching tax involved in stopping their work, preparing for the task, doing the task, and then rebuilding the context regarding the work that floats their boat.
