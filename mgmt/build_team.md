To determine whether permissionless innovation has been unleashed to the degree possible, a simple test is to look at the prevalence of meetings between teams (as distinct from within teams). Cross-team meetings suggest coordination, coupling, and problems with the granularity or functionality of service interfaces. Engineers don't seek out meetings if they can avoid them; such meetings could mean that a service's APIs aren't all that is needed to integrate. An organization that has embraced permissionless innovation should have a high rate of experimentation and a low rate of cross-team meetings.

Wherever knowledge workers perform well in large organiza- tions, senior executives take time out, on a regular schedule, to sit down with them, sometimes all the way down to green juniors, and ask: “What should we at the head of this organ- ization know about your work? What do you want to tell me regarding this organization? Where do you see opportunities we do not exploit? Where do you see dangers to which we are still blind? And, all together, what do you want to know from me about the organization?”

 Any job that has defeated two or three men in succession, even though each had performed well in his previous assignments, must be assumed unfit for human beings. It must be redesigned.

The alternative—to “hire in” new people for new tasks—is too risky. One hires new people to expand on already established and smoothly running activity. But one starts something new with people of tested and proven strength, that is, with veterans. Every new task is such a gamble—even if other people have done the same job many times before—that an experienced and effec- tive executive will not, if humanly possible, add to it the addi- tional gamble of hiring an outsider to take charge.

I have a standing agenda item for all team meetings that reads “gossip, rumors, and lies” and when we hit that agenda item, it’s a chance for everyone on the team to figure out what is the truth and what is a lie

After that’s done, my next measure of a team meeting is: did we make tangible progress on something? I don’t know what you build, so I don’t know what’s broken on your team, but I do know that something is broken and a team meeting is a great place to not only identify the brokenness, but also to start to discuss how to fix it.

The excuse for overstaffing is always the need for a specialist in the team just in case we need him. One should only have on a team the knowledges and skills that are needed day in day out for the bulk of the work. Specialists who are needed once in a while should always remain outside, and hired on contract.

Easier to build new relationship than saving old relationship

You have to care deeply about your people, but not what they think of you

Have strong onboarding documents and employee handbooks. Have new employees improve those onboarding documents

It’s ok, and even desirable to have products with some overlap. Each pushes the other to be better with friendly competition

 It’s your responsibility, therefore, to get your team on the same page: Get used to repeating yourself, and drop the passive-aggressive “as I said last week” and “per my last email.” Research shows that neutral tones come across as negative, and positive tones as neutral. Overcorrect with emoji, GIFs, and explicit communication. Sarcasm and irony are big gambles—our advice is to skip them. 

 At a certain point your learning will plateau, and this is when the second type of work kicks in: executing. This is the act of applying that knowledge to get the job done and create leverage. Eventually, you will create enough leverage to automate the job or grow out of it, and this is when you start the cycle over. Learn. Execute.

For every open job on your team, you need to spend one hour a day on recruiting-related activities. Cap that investment at 50% of your time. 

The value created isn’t just the small decrease in entropy, it’s that you are actively demonstrating being a leader. I understand the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small broken things.

If team members are feeling overwhelmed then you've gone too far. Don't throw your intern to the sharks

changing people's habit is hard - nudging is not very effective at least


KPI- rough range:
40% -  stability LT 2 P1 incidents within half year
25% - innovation , 1 P1 or 2 P2 introduced due to innovation
20% - service acceptance rate 0%
10% -satifaction from front end teams 360 degree review - to avoid arrogance from middle tier team

service does not need stable business, that is how simple service grows to the most valuable IT assets - specific domain expert -> helps innovation in business
