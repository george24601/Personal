### Building relationship

1. Authority care most what you can contribute in the future
2. To affect opinions of people, not only the person himself, but also whoever that can directly affect the said person too. Build common interest between the people around the authority
4. Easier to build new relationship than saving old relationship
5. Can be a leader or follower regardless of current status and self-esteem

a critical feature of effective complex organisations is that they make people do all the jobs.

I was shocked to discover that it was not considered standard to have the overall manager personally vet new hires.

Training is the highest leverage activity a manager can do to increase the output of an organization.  Don’t leave training to outsiders, do it yourself.

never complain your company or your team's task in front your subordinates - and stop the complaints at you! However, it is OK to complain to your boss! 

HR should work with front-line managers to monitor the level of demands they’re placing on people, as well as the balance between demands and resources. The higher the work demands, the higher employees’ need for support, acknowledgement, or opportunities for recovery.

when commenting, compare with the same person's previous product, to cushion the shocks

We also encouraged our employees to interview elsewhere regularly. That was the most reliable and efficient way to learn how competitive our pay was.

“Instead of 150 new people, are you sure you don’t want 75 people whom you pay twice as much because they have twice as much experience and can be higher performers?”
We change by parcticing a different behavior, that, over time, leads us to think about things differently

When you’re new, this is when you are at your most vulnerable. This is because you want to make sense of your environment so you can start being an effective leader.

They take pride in being human shields, absorbing or deflecting heat from inside and outside the company, doing all manner of boring and silly tasks, and battling idiots and slights that make life harder than necessary on their people.

The best bosses orchestrate constructive battles—enabling people to feel safe to speak their minds, even to the leader.

The team members clashed with one another—but these were good fights, built on mutual trust. Indeed, Bird tells his teams, “I want you guys to speak up and drop your drawers. We’re going to look at your scenes in front of everybody. Everyone will get humiliated and encouraged together.”

 If you are a boss, protecting yourself from intrusions may be a lost cause, particularly in the era of e-mail, RSS feeds, and Twitter. But you can run interference for employees, especially those whose work requires concentration, such as engineers, lawyers, nurses, writers, and other knowledge workers.

  But sometimes good bosses face senior leaders and powerful groups that cram bad ideas down everyone’s throat. When your people’s performance or well-being is threatened by idiocy from on high, you need to decide whether to comply or resist, depending on what will help them—and you—most. Sometimes the political costs of defiance are too high, and sometimes seemingly idiotic directives turn out to be useful.

Covering for employees can be painful and risky for a boss, but it can be remarkably effective. It engenders loyalty by demonstrating that you aren’t just spewing out hollow rhetoric about trying to protect them.

it’s important for managers to sit down with their team members and lay out a path for growth.  One on ones are a perfect time to do this, and ensure there’s a time for follow up much sooner than the next review cycle.

they found that people with a mentor to help develop them were much more likely to stick around

When communication breaks down somewhere in the leadership hierarchy, everyone suffers. This is when people feel out of the loop. It’s also when they get frustrated by putting their efforts into work that doesn’t matter.

It’s the job of every manager to help with the flow of information up and down the organization. When people express frustration with leadership, like in the survey above, it’s usually due to a failure in that flow.

Leaders also have a huge impact on the ranks below them. If a leader is disengaged or unhappy, the managers under them are likely to be as well.

Your people are hungry to know how they’re doing. As a manager, you’re best positioned to provide that feedback.

Unfortunately, many companies have over-invested in hygiene factors. High pay, tons of perks, and over-investment in superficial aspects of “company culture” represent the wrong end of the 80-20 rule for impacting the motivation of your people.

Perks can be expensive, but they’re easy. Once you add a perk, it just continues to be a line item on your budget. There’s little you have to think about.

Meanwhile, Motivators are inexpensive, but time-consuming

The next time you think about adding a perk, challenge yourself how beneficial it will really be for your company. Avoid the trap of choosing perks rather than the hard work of improving your managers.

You have to care deeply about your people, but not what they think of you

The way many companies structure their real-time feedback approach is geared towards reaction as opposed to response.

Reaction is immediate and visceral. It’s tied to our reptilian brains, and loaded with emotion.

Response is more thoughtful and measured. It’s high-context, and actionable.

Also, while for the most severe issues immediate response is necessary, in most cases a conversation with context and background would be more effective.

Training programs don’t necessarily need to be expensive, formalized events, but they do need to be intentional.

Talk about great managers as your company's No. 1 benefit.

Most companies design jobs and then slot people into them. Our best managers sometimes do the opposite: When they find talented people, they’re open to creating jobs around them.

The best go out of their way to help people do work they enjoy — even if it means rotating them out of roles where they’re excelling.

 In the first week on the job, managers sit down with their new hires and ask them about their favorite projects they’ve done, the moments when they’ve felt most energized at work, the times when they’ve found themselves totally immersed in a state of flow, and the passions they have outside their jobs. Armed with that knowledge, managers can build engaging roles from the start.

As managers learn who knows what, they can connect the dots — or better yet, build a searchable database of experts. The goal is to put employees’ strengths on display so that people know whom to contact.

The best people are recruited, not bought. The companies who pay top-of-market will always win the salary-optimizing people. The best people optimize to learn (remember Learn vs Earn?). Winning and retaining those people means creating an environment where people are willing to trade short-term compensation for long-term career capital. Many companies think paying the most gets them the best people. They are wrong. Companies that teach the most get the best people.

Have strong onboarding documents and employee handbooks

Have new employees improve those onboarding documents

Focusing on people is arguably the highest leverage activity to spend time on as CEO, since great people build great products, which leads to great profits (in that order)

For example, who to hire, promote, pay more, etc. This should be done by a group of peers or a committee (this is a form of Ray Dalio’s believability weighted decision making).

It’s ok, and even desirable to have products with some overlap. Each pushes the other to be better with friendly competition

It’s easier to hire 90th percentile performers who start doing great work right away, than to train average performers into 90th percentile performers

It’s better to occasionally miss out on a great hire than to make a bad hire. Weight the decision making process to avoid false positives, not false negatives. For example, give veto rights to multiple people: the hiring manager, bar raiser, founder, etc.

People refer friends because it’s a great place to work, not (primarily) for the referral bonus.

Be more like an all-star team than a family. All star teams pay to recruit the best players. Players who don’t contribute or work as a team get cut.

People use judgements made in the first 10 seconds of an interview to form an assessment. These aren’t predictive of outcomes.

Interview based on sample work and structured interview questions
Create pre-defined interview questions that all candidates get asked, then score answers on a consistent rubric. e.g. Tell me about a time when you [outcome that is needed for this role].

Find and develop your best interviewers
Since the interview skillset is not equal, ask the best interviewers to make this a bigger part of their job.

Have at least two interviewers assess each value or key competency
Interviewers should be taking notes and filling out scorecards during every interview.

People Ops should communicate in detail how decisions are made on hiring, promotions, comp, terminations, etc, but not reveal the details of any individual’s situation to respect their privacy.

Manager quality is the single best predictor of whether an employee will stay or leave. Good managers also cause their reports to have higher performance scores.

In training, spend more time on practice/repetition, and less on content
The tough part is getting people to put what they know into practice.

Have the best employees in each area run trainings
Favor internal people over external people for trainings.

Non cash rewards, whether they are experiences (dinner for two, a trip) or gifts (a new phone) trigger an emotional response. When people are surveyed they say they prefer cash awards, but they report higher levels of happiness when receiving experiential awards.


As I’ve reflected on the regrettable departures of folks I’ve managed, hindsight allows me to point to the moment the person changed. Whether it was a detected subtle change or an outright declaration of their boredom, there was a clear sign that the work sitting in front of them was no longer interesting. And I ignored my observation. I assumed it was insignificant. He’s having a bad day. I assumed things would just get better. In reality, the boredom was a seed. What was “I’m bored” grew roots and became “I’m bored and why isn’t anyone doing anything about it?” and sprouted “I’m bored, I told my boss, and he… did nothing,” and finally bloomed into “I don’t want to work at a place where they don’t care if I’m bored.”

I think of boredom as a clock. Every second that someone on my team is bored, a second passes on this clock. After some aggregated amount of seconds that varies for every person, they look at the time, throw up their arms, and quit.

 Here are some narratives that might keep developers around:

“If you implement feature X on or ahead of schedule, we will promote you.”
“With the work that we’re giving you over the next few months, you’re going to become the foremost NoSQL expert in our organization.”
“We recognize that you have a lot of respect for Bob’s Ruby work, so we’re putting you on a project with him to serve as your mentor so that you can learn from him and get to his level.”
“We’re building an accounting package that’s critical to our business, and you are going to be solely responsible for the security and logging portions of it.”
“If your work on project Y keeps going well, we’re going to allow you to choose your next assignment based on which language you’re most interested in using/learning.”

A new team member who says, “I want to be the department’s principal architect” may have his head in the clouds a bit, but you might be able to find a small, one-man project and say, “start by architecting this and we’ll take it from there.”
