Authority care most what you can contribute in the future

To affect opinions of people, not only the person himself, but also whoever that can directly affect the said person too. Build common interest between the people around the authority

Easier to build new relationship than saving old relationship

When you’re new, this is when you are at your most vulnerable. This is because you want to make sense of your environment so you can start being an effective leader.

They take pride in being human shields, absorbing or deflecting heat from inside and outside the company, doing all manner of boring and silly tasks, and battling idiots and slights that make life harder than necessary on their people.

You have to care deeply about your people, but not what they think of you

Have strong onboarding documents and employee handbooks

Have new employees improve those onboarding documents

It’s ok, and even desirable to have products with some overlap. Each pushes the other to be better with friendly competition

In a remote team You need to act like a larger company than you actually are. you need to be stricter about best practices, and you will run into communication problems… a lot of them.

Similarly problematic are satellite offices. The bridge between the offices has 5x communication needs, but people in each office act like co-located teams. Unless the offices can work mostly autonomously, this communication bridge between them will suffer.

If you need a small office, make sure people in it don’t have a critical mass in projects and communicate remote-friendly.

Let’s agree that no matter what we call the situation that the humans who are elsewhere are at a professional disadvantage.1 There is a communication, culture, and context tax applied to the folks who are distributed.2 Your job as a leader to actively invest in reducing that tax.

As the Host, schedule meetings at X:05 or X:35 and get there at X:00 to make sure all technology is set up for a distributed meeting. Not only does this make sure the meeting starts on time, but it sends an important signal.

Assign a Spotter on the Host side. This is the human responsible for paying attention to the distributed folks and looking for visual cues they are ready to speak.

All teams past a certain size become distributed, whether across rooms, floors, buildings, cities, or continents

 It’s your responsibility, therefore, to get your team on the same page: Get used to repeating yourself, and drop the passive-aggressive “as I said last week” and “per my last email.” Research shows that neutral tones come across as negative, and positive tones as neutral. Overcorrect with emoji, GIFs, and explicit communication. Sarcasm and irony are big gambles—our advice is to skip them. 

Combing through an email backlog or discussing strategy on a forum is time-consuming and ultimately ineffective. 

 At a certain point your learning will plateau, and this is when the second type of work kicks in: executing. This is the act of applying that knowledge to get the job done and create leverage. Eventually, you will create enough leverage to automate the job or grow out of it, and this is when you start the cycle over. Learn. Execute.

Maintaining the tempo can become tricky as you build cross-functional units made up of several teams. There will come a point when keeping all teams in sync will have more value to the organization than it will to individual team members.

Designate someone to take notes in the meeting.
Start by reviewing open items from the prior version of this meeting.
Close the meeting by repeating the decisions, the issues that remain open, and the owners of those issues.
Send the notes from that meeting to the broadest possible set of appropriate humans after removing confidential or sensitive topics.

Meetings are a privilege, but the privilege isn’t that you get to go, the privilege is that you get to go to represent your team. This means you show up informed and capable of representing their interests and when the meeting is over that you deftly and capably communicate the results of the meeting to your team.

Write down what you are going to say. Don’t yolo hard conversations.
Share that writing with another neutral human who you know will give you critical feedback. They will find flaws and optimizations that you have not seen.
Sleep on the conversation that you’ve written down and vetted with the neutral humans. Your background processing skills are strong.

 The complete delegation of work to someone else on the team is a vote of confidence in their ability, which is one essential way the trust forms within a team. Letting go of doing the work is tricky, but the gig as a manager isn’t doing quality work, it’s building a healthy team that does quality work at scale.

 Values are principles or standards of behavior, and in a group of humans, they are first defined by the founding employees and then evolved over time by the leadership team. Painting them on the walls or writing them down in an employee handbook makes them accessible and obvious, but it is how these values are consistently applied especially during times of crisis that gives values value.


For every open job on your team, you need to spend one hour a day on recruiting-related activities. Cap that investment at 50% of your time. 

 it’s my belief the moment that when it becomes a struggle to spend 30 minutes a week with each of the folks on your team, it’s time to consider your team might be too big. New managers can handle less people, experienced managers more.

Seven plus or minus three.

What is missing from this dialog is a discussion. The process feels heavy because in this particular hypothetical company, we value velocity over completeness. Whether they’ve written them down or not, the Old Guard embodies the initial values of the company and when they say, “It feels off…” what they are poorly articulating is, “This process that you’re building does not support one (or more) of the key values of the company.”
