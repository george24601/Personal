 At a certain point your learning will plateau, and this is when the second type of work kicks in: executing. This is the act of applying that knowledge to get the job done and create leverage. Eventually, you will create enough leverage to automate the job or grow out of it, and this is when you start the cycle over. Learn. Execute.

 Testing is not something you should take lightly though, and if the consequences of a test outcome are big, say because it requires a large amount of development costs or scrapping a part of your product roadmap, then you really need to ensure your tests are valid and you should conduct the test multiple times to check you get consistent results.

deadline is the best driver: so small deadlines

structured procastination - work on something important but not urgent!

the true end of task - complete work and get evaluation

### On remote teams

- Most work is async by far. People post what they're up to, and other people will go and bother them if they're doing something relevant.

100% on self starters. Micromanagers or workers that require great oversight aren't going to work.

That sounds like how all my best managers have worked, whether on site or remote. Their job is to facilitate your work, not control it.

Innovation is not a group activity, it is always the work of a single individual's creativity. You might think otherwise, that brainstorming and bouncing ideas off each other is important, but you'd be wrong.

“International team” where expectation and default cultural bias are major issues.

You need to act like a larger company than you actually are. you need to be stricter about best practices, and you will run into communication problems… a lot of them.

Similarly problematic are satellite offices. The bridge between the offices has 5x communication needs, but people in each office act like co-located teams. Unless the offices can work mostly autonomously, this communication bridge between them will suffer.

If you need a small office, make sure people in it don’t have a critical mass in projects and communicate remote-friendly.

In remote teams, you need to set up in a way people can be as autonomously as they need. Autonomously doesn’t mean “left alone” it means “be able to run alone” (when needed).

Wait for problems before you introduce solutions (esp. processes or infrastructure)
## Bain's rapid model
R – Recommend
A – Agree
P – Perform
I – Input
D – Decide


R = Responsible: A person actually doing the work. You can have multiple “R” entries for a task. This means more than one person does the work.

A = Accountable: The person who will be ultimately held accountable for the work. Should have only one person

C = Consulted: A person who should be consulted for their opinion. These people may be outside of your team.
Those whose opinions are sought, typically subject matter experts; and with whom there is two-way communication
"C" means that the person doesn’t contribute to doing the work. Instead, you just ask for their input and feedback.

I = Informed: A person who should be informed of the outcome or progress of the work, but they don’t really get a say in how the work is done
Those who are kept up-to-date on progress, often only on completion of the task or deliverable; and with whom there is just one-way communication

 Outside of the AR exception, it is generally recommended that each role in the project or process for each task receive, at most, just one of the participation types. 

Support
Resources allocated to responsible. Unlike consulted, who may provide input to the task, support helps complete the task. Resources which play a supporting role in implementation.

Quality Review
Those who check whether the product meets the quality requirements.

Out of the loop (or omitted)
Designating individuals or groups who are specifically not part of the task. Specifying that a resource does not participate can be as beneficial to a task's completion as specifying those who do participate.

 

PACSI
This is a version very useful to organizations where the output of activities under the accountability of a single person/function can be reviewed and vetoed by multiple stakeholders, due to the collaborative nature of the culture.
Perform
The person/function carrying out the activity.
Accountable
The person/function ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and often the one who delegates the work to the performer.
Control
The person/function reviewing the result of the activity. He or she has a right of veto; his or her advice is binding.
Suggest
The person/function consulted to give advice based upon recognized expertise. The advice is non-binding.
Informed
The person/function who must be informed of the result of the activity.

11.9 The tractability and the invisibility of the software product expose its builders (exceptionally) to perpetual changes in requirements.

13.7 Sometimes one has to go back, scrap a high level, and start over.

15.5 Most documentation fails in giving too little overview. Stand way back and zoom in slowly.
