### Chapter 2 Know Thy Time
Effective executives, in my observation, do not start with their tasks. They start with their time. And they do not start out with planning. They start by finding out where their time actu- ally goes. Then they attempt to manage their time and to cut back unproductive demands on their time. Finally they consoli- date their “discretionary” time into the largest possible continu- ing units. This three-step process:
• recording time,
• managing time, and • consolidating time

These were the tasks on which he knew he should spend time—and therefore memory, obliging as usual, told him that these were the tasks on which he actually had spent his time. 

To be effective, every knowledge worker, and especially every executive, therefore needs to be able to dispose of time in fairly large chunks. To have small dribs and drabs of time at his dis- posal will not be sufficient even if the total is an impressive num- ber of hours

People are time-consumers. And most people are time-wasters.

To spend a few minutes with people is simply not produc- tive. If one wants to get anything across, one has to spend a fairly large minimum quantum of time. The manager who thinks that he can discuss the plans, direction, and performance of one of his subordinates in fifteen minutes—and many managers believe this—is just deceiving himself.

If one wants to get to the point of having an impact, one needs probably at least an hour and usu- ally much more. And if one has to establish a human relation- ship, one needs infinitely more time.

Relations with other knowledge workers are especially time- consuming. Whatever the reason—whether it is the absence of or the barrier of class and authority between superior and subor- dinate in knowledge work, or whether he simply takes himself more seriously—the knowledge worker makes much greater time demands than the manual worker on his superior as well as on his associates. Moreover, because knowledge work cannot be measured the way manual work can, one cannot tell a knowledge worker in a few simple words whether he is doing the right job and how well he is doing it.

Since the knowledge worker directs himself, he must under- stand what achievement is expected of him and why. He must also understand the work of the people who have to use his knowledge output. For this, he needs a good deal of information, discussion, instruction—all things that take time. And contrary to common belief, this time demand is made not only on his superior but equally on his colleagues.o

The knowledge worker must be focused on the results and performance goals of the entire organization to have any results and performance at all. This means that he has to set aside time to direct his vision from his work to results, and from his spe- cialty to the outside in which alone performance lies.

Wherever knowledge workers perform well in large organiza- tions, senior executives take time out, on a regular schedule, to sit down with them, sometimes all the way down to green juniors, and ask: “What should we at the head of this organ- ization know about your work? What do you want to tell me regarding this organization? Where do you see opportunities we do not exploit? Where do you see dangers to which we are still blind? And, all together, what do you want to know from me about the organization?”

 But fast personnel deci- sions are likely to be wrong decisions. The time quantum of the good personnel decision is amazingly large. What the decision involves often becomes clear only when one has gone around the same track several times.o

But without exception, they make personnel decisions slowly and they make them sev- eral times before they really commit themselves.

all effective executives I have had occasion to observe have learned that they have to give several hours of continuous and uninterrupted thought to decisions on people if they hope to come up with the right answer.

Time-use does improve with practice. But only constant efforts at managing time can prevent drifting.o

Effective executives have learned to ask systematically and without coyness: “What do I do that wastes your time without contributing to your effec- tiveness?”

They are afraid to cut out something important by mistake. But this mistake, if made, can be speedily corrected. If one prunes too harshly, one usually finds out fast enough.

The first task here is to identify the time-wasters which follow from lack of system or foresight. The symptom to look for is the recurrent “crisis,” the crisis that comes back year after year. A crisis that recurs a second time is a crisis that must not occur again.

Then I have half an hour in which I return every call and make sure I get every message. I have yet to come across a crisis which could not wait ninety minutes.

Another fairly common method is to schedule a daily work period at home in the morning.

spent ninety minutes each morning before going to work in a study without telephone at home. Even if this means working very early so as to get to the office on time, it is preferable to the most popular way of getting to the important work: taking it home in the evening and spending three hours after dinner on it. By that time, most executives are too tired to do a good job. 

Effective executives start out by estimating how much discre- tionary time they can realistically call their own. Then they set aside continuous time in the appropriate amount. And if they find later that other matters encroach on this reserve, they scruti- nize their record again and get rid of some more time demands from less than fully productive activities.

### Chapter 1 Effectiveness Can Be Learned
executives who do not manage themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their own job and work set the wrong example.

Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for,


For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things done. 

Working on the right things is what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work.
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that is, toward effectiveness.

Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “exec- utive” if, by virtue of his position or knowledge,

Such a man (or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping.

Knowledge work is not defined by quantity. Neither is knowledge work defined by its costs. Knowledge work is defined by its results. 

If the executive lets the flow of events determine what he does, what he works on, and what he takes seriously, he will fritter himself away “operating.”o

What the executive needs are criteria which enable him to work on the truly important, that is, on contributions and results, even though the criteria are not found in the flow of events.

What happens inside any organization is effort and cost. To speak of “profit centers” in a business as we are wont to do is polite euphemism. There are only effort centers. The less an organization has to do to produce results, the better it does its job. 

The fewer people, the smaller, the less activity inside, the more nearly perfect is the organization in terms of its only reason for existence: the service to the environment.

Unless he makes special efforts to gain direct access to out- side reality, he will become increasingly inside-focused. The higher up in the organization he goes, the more will his attention be drawn to problems and challenges of the inside rather than to events on the outside.

 One can, however, by and large quantify only what goes on inside an organization—costs and production figures, patient statistics in the hospital, or training reports. The relevant outside events are rarely available in quantifiable form until it is much too late to do anything about them.

For a fact, after all, is an event which somebody has defined, has classified and, above all, has endowed with relevance. To be able to quantify one has to have a concept first.

The truly important events on the outside are not the trends. They are changes in the trends. 

Such changes, however, have to be perceived; they cannot be counted, defined, or classified. The classifications still produce the expected fig- ures—as they did for Edsel. But the figures no longer correspond to actual behavior.

The important events on the outside cannot be reported in the kind of form a com- puter (or any other logic system) could possibly handle. Man, however, while not particularly logical is perceptive—and that is his strength.

Executives may become blind to everything that is perception (i.e., event) rather than fact (i.e., after the event). 

The computer only makes visible a condition that existed before it.

Unless they make conscious efforts to perceive the out- side, the inside may blind them to the true reality.

We will have to learn to build organizations in such a man- ner that any man who has strength in one important area is capa- ble of putting it to work

One need not know in detail what to do with “human relations” as an accountant, or how to promote a new branded product if an engineer. But one has a responsibility to know at least what these areas are about, why they are around, and what they are trying to do.

Effective executives know where their time goes. They work systematically at managing the little of their time that can be brought under their control.

Effective executives focus on outward contribution. They gear their efforts to results rather than to work. They start out with the question, “What results are expected of me?” rather than with the work to be done, let alone with its techniques and tools.

They do not build on weakness. They do not start out with the things they cannot do.

Effective executives concentrate on the few major areas where superior performance will produce outstanding results.

They know that an effective decision is always a judgment based on “dissenting opinions” rather than on “consensus on the facts.” And they know that to make many decisions fast means to make the wrong decisions. What is needed are few, but fundamental, decisions. What is needed is the right strategy rather than razzle-dazzle tactics.
