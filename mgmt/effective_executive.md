###  Conclusion: Effectiveness Must Be Learned


### Chapter 5 First Things First

The alternative—to “hire in” new people for new tasks—is too risky. One hires new people to expand on already established and smoothly running activity. But one starts something new with people of tested and proven strength, that is, with veterans. Every new task is such a gamble—even if other people have done the same job many times before—that an experienced and effec- tive executive will not, if humanly possible, add to it the addi- tional gamble of hiring an outsider to take charge.


### Chapter 4 Making Strength Productive

 Any job that has defeated two or three men in succession, even though each had performed well in his previous assignments, must be assumed unfit for human beings. It must be redesigned.


### Chapter 2 Know Thy Time

Wherever knowledge workers perform well in large organiza- tions, senior executives take time out, on a regular schedule, to sit down with them, sometimes all the way down to green juniors, and ask: “What should we at the head of this organ- ization know about your work? What do you want to tell me regarding this organization? Where do you see opportunities we do not exploit? Where do you see dangers to which we are still blind? And, all together, what do you want to know from me about the organization?”
