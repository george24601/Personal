### Chapter 4 Making Strength Productive

The effective executive fills posi- tions and promotes on the basis of what a man can do. He does not make staffing decisions to minimize weaknesses but to maxi- mize strength.

The executive who is concerned with what a man cannot do rather than with what he can do, and who therefore tries to avoid weakness rather than make strength effective is a weak man him- self. He probably sees strength in others as a threat to himself.

To try to build against weakness frustrates the purpose of organization. Organization is the specific instrument to make human strengths redound to performance while human weak- ness is neutralized and largely rendered harmless. The very strong neither need nor desire organization. They are much better off working on their own.

The main reason is that the immediate task of the executive is not to place a man; it is to fill a job. The tendency is therefore to start out with the job as being a part of the order of nature. Then one looks for a man to fill the job. It is only too easy to be misled this way into looking for the “least misfit” —the one man who leaves least to be desired. And this is invariably the medioc- rity.
The widely advertised “cure” for this is to structure jobs to fit the personalities available. But this cure is worse than the dis- ease—except perhaps in a very small and simple organization. Jobs have to be objective; that is, determined by task rather than by personality.

Jobs in an organization are interdependent and interlocked. One can- not change everybody’s work and responsibility just because one has to replace a single man in a single job. To structure a job to a person is almost certain to result in the end in greater discrep- ancy between the demands of the job and the available talent. It results in a dozen people being uprooted and pushed around in order to accommodate one.

To tolerate diversity, relationships must be task-focused rather than personality-focused. Achievement must be measured against objective criteria of contribution and per- formance. This is possible, however, only if jobs are defined and structured impersonally. Otherwise the accent will be on “Who is right?” rather than on “What is right?” In no time, personnel decisions will be made on “Do I like this fellow?” or “Will he be acceptable?” rather than by asking “Is he the man most likely to do an outstanding job?”

 Any job that has defeated two or three men in succession, even though each had performed well in his previous assignments, must be assumed unfit for human beings. It must be redesigned.

All one can measure is performance. And all one should measure is performance. This is another reason for making jobs big and challenging. It is also a reason for thinking through the contribution a man should make to the results and the perform- ance of his organization.

Effective executives rarely suffer from the delusion that two mediocrities achieve as much as one good man. They have learned that, as a rule, two mediocrities achieve even less than one mediocrity—they just get in each other’s way. 

They are above all intolerant of the argument: “I can’t spare this man; I’d be in trouble without him.” They have learned that there are only three explanations for an “indispensable man”: He is actually incompetent and can only survive if carefully shielded from demands; his strength is misused to bolster a weak superior who cannot stand on his own two feet; or his strength is misused to delay tackling a serious problem if not to conceal its existence.

But Marshall also insisted that to relieve a man from command was less a judgment on the man than on the com- mander who had appointed him. “The only thing we know is that this spot was the wrong one for the man,” he argued. “This does not mean that he is not the ideal man for some other job. Appointing him was my mistake, now it’s up to me to find what he can do.”

Marshall was only concerned with weaknesses when they limited the full development of a man’s strength. These he tried to overcome through work and career opportunities.

This should be elementary prudence. Contrary to popular legend, subordinates do not, as a rule, rise to position and prominence over the prostrate bodies of incompetent bosses. If their boss is not promoted, they will tend to be bottled up behind him. And if their boss is relieved for incompetence or failure, the successor is rarely the bright, young man next in line. He usually is brought in from the outside and brings with him his own bright, young men. Conversely, there is nothing quite as conducive to success, as a successful and rapidly promoted superior.

Subordinates typically want to “reform” the boss. The able senior civil servant is inclined to see himself as the tutor to the newly appointed political head of his agency. He tries to get his boss to overcome his limitations. The effective ones ask instead: “What can the new boss do?” And if the answer is: “He is good at relationships with Congress, the White House, and the public,” then the civil servant works at mak- ing it possible for his minister to use these abilities.

People who are both readers and listen- ers—trial lawyers have to be both, as a rule—are exceptions. It is generally a waste of time to talk to a reader. He only listens after he has read. It is equally a waste of time to submit a voluminous report to a listener. He can only grasp what it is all about through the spoken word.

The adaptation needed to think through the strengths of the boss and to try to make them productive always affects the “how” rather than the “what.” It concerns the order in which dif- ferent areas, all of them relevant, are presented, rather than what is important or right. If the superior’s strength lies in his political ability in a job in which political ability is truly relevant, then one presents to him first the political aspect of a situation. This enables him to grasp what the issue is all about and to put his strength effectively behind a new policy.

The assertion that “somebody else will not let me do any- thing” should always be suspected as a cover-up for inertia. 

The effective executive knows that it is easier to raise the performance of one leader than it is to raise the per- formance of a whole mass. He therefore makes sure that he puts into the leadership position, into the standard-setting, the per- formance-making position, the man who has the strength to do the outstanding, the pace-setting job. This always requires focus on the one strength of a man and dismissal of weaknesses as irrel- evant unless they hamper the full deployment of the available strength.


### Chapter 3 What Can I Contribute?

The great majority of executives tend to focus downward. They are occupied with efforts rather than with results. They worry over what the organization and their superiors “owe” them and should do for them. And they are conscious above all of the authority they “should have.” As a result, they render themselves ineffectual.

“And what do you do that justifies your being on the pay- roll?” The great majority, he reports, answer: “I run the accounting department,” or “I am in charge of the sales force.” Indeed, not uncommonly the answer is, “I have 850 people working under me.” Only a few say, “It’s my job to give our managers the information they need to make the right decisions,” or “I am responsible for finding out what products the customer will want tomorrow,” or “I have to think through and prepare the decisions the president will have to face tomorrow.”

“Contribution,” as the two illustrations just given show, may mean different things. For every organization needs per- formance in three major areas: It needs direct results; building of values and their reaffirmation; and building and develop- ing people for tomorrow. If deprived of performance in any one of these areas, it will decay and die. 

The most common cause of executive failure is inability or unwillingness to change with the demands of a new position. The executive who keeps on doing what he has done successfully before he moved is almost bound to fail. Not only do the results change to which his contribution ought to direct itself. The rela- tive importance between the three dimensions of performance changes. The executive who fails to understand this will sud- denly do the wrong things the wrong way—even though he does exactly what in his old job had been the right things done the right way.

In fact, he can, as a rule, be effective only if he has learned to do one thing very well; that is, if he has special- ized. By itself, however, a specialty is a fragment and sterile. Its output has to be put together with the output of other specialists before it can produce results.

But executives who take responsibility for contribution in their own work will as a rule demand that their subordinates take responsibility too. They will tend to ask their men: “What are the contributions for which this organization and I, your supe- rior, should hold you accountable? What should we expect of you? What is the best utilization of your knowledge and your ability?” And then communication becomes possible, becomes indeed easy.

The executive who focuses on contribution also stimulates others to develop themselves, whether they are subordinates, col- leagues, or superiors. He sets standards which are not personal but grounded in the requirements of the task. 

They ask themselves: “Why are we having this meeting? Do we want a decision, do we want to inform, or do we want to make clear to ourselves what we should be doing?” They insist that the purpose be thought through and spelled out before a meeting is called, a report asked for, or a presentation organized. They insist that the meeting serve the contribution to which they have committed themselves.



### Chapter 2 Know Thy Time
Effective executives, in my observation, do not start with their tasks. They start with their time. And they do not start out with planning. They start by finding out where their time actu- ally goes. Then they attempt to manage their time and to cut back unproductive demands on their time. Finally they consoli- date their “discretionary” time into the largest possible continu- ing units. This three-step process:
• recording time,
• managing time, and • consolidating time

These were the tasks on which he knew he should spend time—and therefore memory, obliging as usual, told him that these were the tasks on which he actually had spent his time. 

To be effective, every knowledge worker, and especially every executive, therefore needs to be able to dispose of time in fairly large chunks. To have small dribs and drabs of time at his dis- posal will not be sufficient even if the total is an impressive num- ber of hours

People are time-consumers. And most people are time-wasters.

To spend a few minutes with people is simply not produc- tive. If one wants to get anything across, one has to spend a fairly large minimum quantum of time. The manager who thinks that he can discuss the plans, direction, and performance of one of his subordinates in fifteen minutes—and many managers believe this—is just deceiving himself.

If one wants to get to the point of having an impact, one needs probably at least an hour and usu- ally much more. And if one has to establish a human relation- ship, one needs infinitely more time.

Relations with other knowledge workers are especially time- consuming. Whatever the reason—whether it is the absence of or the barrier of class and authority between superior and subor- dinate in knowledge work, or whether he simply takes himself more seriously—the knowledge worker makes much greater time demands than the manual worker on his superior as well as on his associates. Moreover, because knowledge work cannot be measured the way manual work can, one cannot tell a knowledge worker in a few simple words whether he is doing the right job and how well he is doing it.

Since the knowledge worker directs himself, he must under- stand what achievement is expected of him and why. He must also understand the work of the people who have to use his knowledge output. For this, he needs a good deal of information, discussion, instruction—all things that take time. And contrary to common belief, this time demand is made not only on his superior but equally on his colleagues.o

The knowledge worker must be focused on the results and performance goals of the entire organization to have any results and performance at all. This means that he has to set aside time to direct his vision from his work to results, and from his spe- cialty to the outside in which alone performance lies.

Wherever knowledge workers perform well in large organiza- tions, senior executives take time out, on a regular schedule, to sit down with them, sometimes all the way down to green juniors, and ask: “What should we at the head of this organ- ization know about your work? What do you want to tell me regarding this organization? Where do you see opportunities we do not exploit? Where do you see dangers to which we are still blind? And, all together, what do you want to know from me about the organization?”

 But fast personnel deci- sions are likely to be wrong decisions. The time quantum of the good personnel decision is amazingly large. What the decision involves often becomes clear only when one has gone around the same track several times.o

But without exception, they make personnel decisions slowly and they make them sev- eral times before they really commit themselves.

all effective executives I have had occasion to observe have learned that they have to give several hours of continuous and uninterrupted thought to decisions on people if they hope to come up with the right answer.

Time-use does improve with practice. But only constant efforts at managing time can prevent drifting.o

Effective executives have learned to ask systematically and without coyness: “What do I do that wastes your time without contributing to your effec- tiveness?”

They are afraid to cut out something important by mistake. But this mistake, if made, can be speedily corrected. If one prunes too harshly, one usually finds out fast enough.

The first task here is to identify the time-wasters which follow from lack of system or foresight. The symptom to look for is the recurrent “crisis,” the crisis that comes back year after year. A crisis that recurs a second time is a crisis that must not occur again.

Then I have half an hour in which I return every call and make sure I get every message. I have yet to come across a crisis which could not wait ninety minutes.

Another fairly common method is to schedule a daily work period at home in the morning.

spent ninety minutes each morning before going to work in a study without telephone at home. Even if this means working very early so as to get to the office on time, it is preferable to the most popular way of getting to the important work: taking it home in the evening and spending three hours after dinner on it. By that time, most executives are too tired to do a good job. 

Effective executives start out by estimating how much discre- tionary time they can realistically call their own. Then they set aside continuous time in the appropriate amount. And if they find later that other matters encroach on this reserve, they scruti- nize their record again and get rid of some more time demands from less than fully productive activities.

### Chapter 1 Effectiveness Can Be Learned
executives who do not manage themselves for effectiveness cannot possibly expect to manage their associates and subordinates. Management is largely by example. Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their own job and work set the wrong example.

Effectiveness is what executives are being paid for,


For manual work, we need only efficiency; that is, the ability to do things right rather than the ability to get the right things done. 

Working on the right things is what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work.
The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he must direct himself toward performance and contribution, that is, toward effectiveness.

Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an “exec- utive” if, by virtue of his position or knowledge,

Such a man (or woman) must make decisions; he cannot just carry out orders. He must take responsibility for his contribution. And he is supposed, by virtue of his knowledge, to be better equipped to make the right decision than anyone else. He may be overridden; he may be demoted or fired. But so long as he has the job the goals, the standards, and the contribution are in his keeping.

Knowledge work is not defined by quantity. Neither is knowledge work defined by its costs. Knowledge work is defined by its results. 

If the executive lets the flow of events determine what he does, what he works on, and what he takes seriously, he will fritter himself away “operating.”o

What the executive needs are criteria which enable him to work on the truly important, that is, on contributions and results, even though the criteria are not found in the flow of events.

What happens inside any organization is effort and cost. To speak of “profit centers” in a business as we are wont to do is polite euphemism. There are only effort centers. The less an organization has to do to produce results, the better it does its job. 

The fewer people, the smaller, the less activity inside, the more nearly perfect is the organization in terms of its only reason for existence: the service to the environment.

Unless he makes special efforts to gain direct access to out- side reality, he will become increasingly inside-focused. The higher up in the organization he goes, the more will his attention be drawn to problems and challenges of the inside rather than to events on the outside.

 One can, however, by and large quantify only what goes on inside an organization—costs and production figures, patient statistics in the hospital, or training reports. The relevant outside events are rarely available in quantifiable form until it is much too late to do anything about them.

For a fact, after all, is an event which somebody has defined, has classified and, above all, has endowed with relevance. To be able to quantify one has to have a concept first.

The truly important events on the outside are not the trends. They are changes in the trends. 

Such changes, however, have to be perceived; they cannot be counted, defined, or classified. The classifications still produce the expected fig- ures—as they did for Edsel. But the figures no longer correspond to actual behavior.

The important events on the outside cannot be reported in the kind of form a com- puter (or any other logic system) could possibly handle. Man, however, while not particularly logical is perceptive—and that is his strength.

Executives may become blind to everything that is perception (i.e., event) rather than fact (i.e., after the event). 

The computer only makes visible a condition that existed before it.

Unless they make conscious efforts to perceive the out- side, the inside may blind them to the true reality.

We will have to learn to build organizations in such a man- ner that any man who has strength in one important area is capa- ble of putting it to work

One need not know in detail what to do with “human relations” as an accountant, or how to promote a new branded product if an engineer. But one has a responsibility to know at least what these areas are about, why they are around, and what they are trying to do.

Effective executives know where their time goes. They work systematically at managing the little of their time that can be brought under their control.

Effective executives focus on outward contribution. They gear their efforts to results rather than to work. They start out with the question, “What results are expected of me?” rather than with the work to be done, let alone with its techniques and tools.

They do not build on weakness. They do not start out with the things they cannot do.

Effective executives concentrate on the few major areas where superior performance will produce outstanding results.

They know that an effective decision is always a judgment based on “dissenting opinions” rather than on “consensus on the facts.” And they know that to make many decisions fast means to make the wrong decisions. What is needed are few, but fundamental, decisions. What is needed is the right strategy rather than razzle-dazzle tactics.
