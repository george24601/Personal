A decision is a judgement. It is a choice between alternatives. It is rarely a choice between right and wrong.
The effective executive knows that people do not start out with the search for facts. They start out with an opinion.
People inevitably start out with an opinion: to ask them to search for facts first is even undesirable.
The only rigorous method, the only one that enables us to test an opinion against reality, is based on the clear recognition that opinions came first-and that is the way it should be.
The effective executive encourages opinions. He then asks: “What would the facts have to be to make this opinion tenable?”


There is a fairly reliable symptom of overstaffing. If the senior people in the group spend more than one-tenth of their time on problems of human relations, on feuds and frictions, on jurisdictional disputes, then the workforce is almost certainly too large.
In a lean organization, people have room to move without colliding with one another, and can do the work without having to explain it all the time.
The excuse for overstaffing is always the need for a specialist in the team just in case we need him. One should only have on a team the knowledges and skills that are needed day in day out for the bulk of the work. Specialists who are needed once in a while should always remain outside, and hired on contract.

As a rule, meetings should never be allowed to become the main demand on an executive’s time.

Too many meetings signify that work that should be in one job or one component is spread over several jobs or several components. They signify that the responsibility is diffused.

Senior executives rarely have as much as one quarter of their time truly at their disposal and available for the important matters, the matters that contribute, the matters they are being paid for.
The higher up an executive, the larger will the proportion of his time that is not under his control and not spent on contribution. Therefore, the effective executive knows that he has to consolidate his discretionary time (the time that makes real contribution).

He knows that he needs large chunks of time and small chunks are of no value at all.
Some senior men work at home one day a week: a common method for time consolidation.
Other people schedule all the operating work — meetings, reviews, problem session — for two days a week, and set aside mornings of the remaining days for consistent, containing work on major issues.
Effective executives start by ESTIMATING how much discretionary time they can realistically call their own. Then they set aside continous time in the appropriate manner.

They ask themselves, “why are we having this meeting?””Do we want a decision, or do we want to inform, or do we want to make clear to ourselves what we should be doing?”
They insist that the purpose be thought through and spelt out before a meeting is called.
The effective executive always states at the outset of a meeting the specific purpose and contribution it is to achieve. He does not allow a meeting called to inform to degenerate into a brainstorming session in which everyone shares a bright idea.

He always at the end of the meetings, goes back to the opening statement and relates the final conclusions to the original intent

structured procastination - work on something important but not urgent!

if you are checking your phone couple of seconds, it is a sign you are tired, fatigued

Second, each week you need to carve off at least five hours to work on this big rock project with sessions no smaller than one hour. This is on your calendar protected time that you can’t reschedule. It’s as important as your 1:1s and your staff meeting. You are going to love this.

The best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know what will happen next. If you do that every day when you are writing a novel, you will never be stuck
 in his own life, he was much more motivated to get back to tasks if he had left them when they were going well.

 Instead of just having a vision of the direction your work is heading in, they took the liberty of adding two more principles: people should feel that they are close to finishing the task, and it should be challenging enough so that you care if you complete it or not.

 When an interruption prevents individuals from achieving a particular goal or task, they make faster and less thoughtful decisions in completely unrelated areas

 To harness the effect properly, the interruption should be scheduled for when you feel like you know where you’re going with your work

 The idea is that by helping students to split up their work, the Hemingway effect will kick in as they approach the end of each section.

Combing through an email backlog or discussing strategy on a forum is time-consuming and ultimately ineffective. 

Duckworth first recommends taking a future-oriented approach to your day, such as planning breaks and the time slots for checking emails in advance. If you can refrain from resigning to your urges before the time you’ve allotted for yourself, you may achieve a greater handle on your overall self-control.
