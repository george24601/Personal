But we do not break down story into every last detail. Talk with customer about details when details become important. 

But story is not contract, test is!

customer team: tests, PM, real users (as comprehensive as possible), interaction designers.  They are visioneris, and write story in a story writing workshop 

velocity: how much work a developer can do in an iteration

customer team can make corrections before the start of each iteration

extreme character: unlikely users for the systems, to lead to stories that you may miss

try not to include dependency between stories

When as much detail is added , the dicussions abou the story ar emuch morelikely to feel concrete and real. This can lead to the mistaken belief that the story reflects all details

details that been determined through conversations become tests

many stories are evaluated by purchasers than users

if dev does not have the domain knowledge, talk to the user to figure out

responsible for helping the customer write stories that are promises to converse rather than detailed specifications

When slicing stories, they should be sliced vertically, rather than horizontally.

By creating vertically-sliced stories, the team has a clear picture of what specific tasks need to be completed to add value for the end-user, and the tasks are more discrete and easier to keep track of.
