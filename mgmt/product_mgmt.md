### Competitor analysis
* Need to clarify goals, including
* requirements, problems, new things, missing part each side has, i.e., delta on both sides
* Not UX analysis, normally just focus on a single module
* Business process , information display, operation steps, functionality entrance
* To B product: harder to gather info, probably dive deeper on a smaller area compared to to C products
* Need to keep track of its iterations and change too
* Use table to compare features between products
* Interactive design: no need to dive too deep
* Use the competitors!
* To B product, more focus on process and functionality analysis, how the product evolved, Pricing model, suppport policy. Target audience
* Talk to the customer, especially to B products
* check news on the competitor
* Who are the target users, which industry, location, size, distribution etc Case study
* What is the core requiremnt they build upon?
* Table comparsion on features,break down the feature, no need to be super detailed -> but later on need to dive deep on every page and every elements
* Easy to scope screep
* Don't let them to drive product road map
* keep updating, change over time is important


Daily Active User/Monthly Active User ratio: DAU/MAU of 20 percent is considered a good sign, while 50+ percent indicates extreme success

Customer retention rate (CRR) is the percentage of customers who stayed with the company after a certain time period
According to the Product Benchmarks Report by Mixpanel, the average CRR for most software products is below 20 percent over 8 weeks

But we do not break down story into every last detail. Talk with customer about details when details become important. 

But story is not contract, test is!

customer team: tests, PM, real users (as comprehensive as possible), interaction designers.  They are visioneris, and write story in a story writing workshop 

velocity: how much work a developer can do in an iteration

customer team can make corrections before the start of each iteration

extreme character: unlikely users for the systems, to lead to stories that you may miss

try not to include dependency between stories

When as much detail is added , the dicussions abou the story are much morelikely to feel concrete and real. This can lead to the mistaken belief that the story reflects all details

details that been determined through conversations become tests

if dev does not have the domain knowledge, talk to the user to figure out

responsible for helping the customer write stories that are promises to converse rather than detailed specifications

When slicing stories, they should be sliced vertically, rather than horizontally.

By creating vertically-sliced stories, the team has a clear picture of what specific tasks need to be completed to add value for the end-user, and the tasks are more discrete and easier to keep track of.
