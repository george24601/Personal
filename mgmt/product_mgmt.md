P13: AB test lowered barrier to entry, and weaker PM can use good result to slack off on thinking on customers
P23: Bar of PM 
1.to understand the domain model of a user - able to predict with reasonable accurancy on the effect of iteration
2. research user model, and analyze with real individual as sample

User with consistent perference and congnition, no need for devising special scenarios. Otherwise, extra work needed to guide user so that he would max expected utility by conducting the certain behaviurs

hierchary inside company needs to be higher efficiency than market. Each expert needs to make better than average decision at his position. Hierarchy here means the professionals

Outcome of product:
1. financial gain
2.  domain know-how, self-evaluation and awareness, innovation
3. team which works well with each other
4. trust beteann user and upstream/downstream stakehodlers. This reduces transaction costs of new transactions and products

Once own something and selling it means some form of loss. negative unitily loss is about 2.5 times of positive gain brought by the same amount

Flaw to analyze user as a natural person, i.e., # of registered user is  flawed - company may ignore what utilities does it provide, and how many requirements are satified by the user.

Simmialy, for DAU, same DAU may mean much more user value, if it satifies more user requirements as it goes

Tech data improment has low coorelation with the utility user feels. This means we should decompose products into utilities, and then analyze iteration's effect on the utilites, and then predict user behavior change caused by utilities change

112
source of transaction costs
1. bounded rationality
2. opportunism: mistrust between parties means increased monitoring cost
3. uncertainty and complexity: have to pricing them in 
4. small number
5. information asymmetric
6. atmosphere

113
TC in market
1. search and measure
2. compare and decide
3. execution and guarantee

115
If user's trust is far off from facts
standarize product to make quality easy to manage, and thus to reduce TC

132
for bigger platforms, it is about trade off instead of innovation and design
136
convert absolutely new users asap, this will increase the conversion cost for competitors

142
data driven will slow down decision process, 
only possible with cheap, readily available data

146
extra profit comes from people with good judgement - often not data driven
when have an idea, write it down and try to disprove it, and update it with new info and context in the future
157
user should mean a combination of requiremens in a certain scenario
159
if your manager or partner lacks critical thinking skills, agree and praise on minor points, make him FEEL that you are similar, after than insist on major points
283
find but not create requirement
use willing to pay - company cost to decide if it is good business
288
PM needs judgement on the decision's certainty and feasiblity
care about feedback but not suggestion


315
PM needs judgement on when to data driven and when to use as only the reference point
320
need to be able to split the difference. Avoid right but aggressive person
326
PM needs to have good ability in decision making, commercial, professional. If only product, then CEO or founder is the biggest PM




There are two types of ARPU: per new account and per existing account. ARPU per new account refers to metrics based on new accounts appearing after the subscription plan or product price was changed. ARPU per existing account involves the data from accounts established before the price change.

Sales & marketing spendings for a period of time / total # of customers generated for a period of time = CAC

Daily Active User/Monthly Active User ratio: DAU/MAU of 20 percent is considered a good sign, while 50+ percent indicates extreme success

Customer retention rate (CRR) is the percentage of customers who stayed with the company after a certain time period
According to the Product Benchmarks Report by Mixpanel, the average CRR for most software products is below 20 percent over 8 weeks

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
Customer Conversion Rate (CCR)
Repurchase Rate (RR)
Daily Active Users (DAU)
Feature Usage (FU, yes thatâ€™s really the abbreviation)
User Churn (UC)
Net Promoter Score (NPS)
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

tech vs customer/analyst/domain expoert communication: either side dominates => project loses

But we do not break down story into every last detail. Talk with customer about details when details become important. 

But story is not contract, test is!

customer team: tests, PM, real users (as comprehensive as possible), interaction designers.  They are visioneris, and write story in a story writing workshop 

velocity: how much work a developer can do in an iteration

customer team can make corrections before the start of each iteration

also need to rip unimportant role cards for roles that are unimportant to the success of the system

extreme character: unlikely users for the systems, to lead to stories that you may miss

try not to include dependency between stories

When as much detail is added , the dicussions abou the story ar emuch morelikely to feel concrete and real. This can lead to the mistaken belief that the story reflects all details

details that been determined through conversations become tests

many stories are evaluated by purchasers than users

if dev does not have the domain knowledge, talk to the user to figure out

responsible for helping the customer write stories that are promises to converse rather than detailed specifications

When slicing stories, they should be sliced vertically, rather than horizontally.

By creating vertically-sliced stories, the team has a clear picture of what specific tasks need to be completed to add value for the end-user, and the tasks are more discrete and easier to keep track of.
