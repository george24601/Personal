There are two types of ARPU: per new account and per existing account. ARPU per new account refers to metrics based on new accounts appearing after the subscription plan or product price was changed. ARPU per existing account involves the data from accounts established before the price change.

Sales & marketing spendings for a period of time / total # of customers generated for a period of time = CAC

Daily Active User/Monthly Active User ratio: DAU/MAU of 20 percent is considered a good sign, while 50+ percent indicates extreme success

Customer retention rate (CRR) is the percentage of customers who stayed with the company after a certain time period
According to the Product Benchmarks Report by Mixpanel, the average CRR for most software products is below 20 percent over 8 weeks

The core principles you should focus on as a product manager revolves around product usage, customer-centric design (especially user experience), competitive offerings, pricing, market share and industry trends.

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
Customer Conversion Rate (CCR)
Repurchase Rate (RR)
Daily Active Users (DAU)
Feature Usage (FU, yes that’s really the abbreviation)
User Churn (UC)
Net Promoter Score (NPS)
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

, the number one priority for your data should be finding the overall “product-market fit.” Usage data (like events) is a good place to start for this, but you absolutely need to include customer feedback. One manager I talked to said that no observational usage data has ever stacked up to the insight she gains from picking up the phone and talking to 10 customers directly. As a general rule I agree with her but it’s not just because conversations have magical power (though they do) it’s because you probably haven’t setup formal tests for evaluating the usage data.

tech vs customer/analyst/domain expoert communication: either side dominates => project loses

But we do not break down story into every last detail. Talk with customer about details when details become important. 

But story is not contract, test is!

customer team: tests, PM, real users (as comprehensive as possible), interaction designers.  They are visioneris, and write story in a story writing workshop 

velocity: how much work a developer can do in an iteration

customer team can make corrections before the start of each iteration

also need to rip unimportant role cards for roles that are unimportant to the success of the system

extreme character: unlikely users for the systems, to lead to stories that you may miss

try not to include dependency between stories

When as much detail is added , the dicussions abou the story ar emuch morelikely to feel concrete and real. This can lead to the mistaken belief that the story reflects all details

details that been determined through conversations become tests

many stories are evaluated by purchasers than users

if dev does not have the domain knowledge, talk to the user to figure out

responsible for helping the customer write stories that are promises to converse rather than detailed specifications

When slicing stories, they should be sliced vertically, rather than horizontally.

I tend to prefer establishing DRIs for sub-priorities with a team. The DRI is responsible for a sub-priority or sub-component but it's not their identity; they're still expected to work on other stuff on the team and to focus their energies on whatever matters most to the team as a whole.

By creating vertically-sliced stories, the team has a clear picture of what specific tasks need to be completed to add value for the end-user, and the tasks are more discrete and easier to keep track of.
