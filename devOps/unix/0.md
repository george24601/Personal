& will not terminate in SIGINT, i.e., the one sent by Ctrl + C, but will terminate on SIGHUP,i.e, end the session. With nohup, have to use kill command

Ctrl + Z setps SIGTSTP, it will hangout in the process -> can use the `jobs` to see stopped process, use `bg` to restore it to see stopped process, use `bg` to restore it. Overall, very similar to gedit &

Note that `kill` accepts job id too, but need to put `%` in front of the id, otherwise, it will be treated as PID.
