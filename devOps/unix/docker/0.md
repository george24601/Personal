There can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile. If you list more than one CMD then only the last CMD will take effect.

In fact, if you want your image to be runnable (without additional docker run command line arguments) you must specify an ENTRYPOINT or CMD.

we can override the default CMD by specifying an argument after the image name when starting the container

The default ENTRYPOINT can be similarly overridden but it requires the use of the --entrypoint

Combining ENTRYPOINT and CMD allows you to specify the default executable for your image while also providing default arguments to that executable which may be overridden by the user. Let's look at an example

When using ENTRYPOINT and CMD together it's important that you always use the exec form of both instructions. Trying to use the shell form, or mixing-and-matching the shell and exec forms will almost never give you the result you want.

The bridge network represents the docker0 network present in all Docker installations. the Docker daemon connects containers to this network by default. You can see this bridge as part of a host’s network stack by using the ip addr show command

the containerized file system is isolated from the outside (via mount namespaces), the processes in the container appear as if they were the only ones on the host (via PID namespaces) and so on.

it’s also possible to limit the amount of physical resources a container can consume. This is achieved via cgroups

Links in docker-compose
------
Link to containers in another service. Either specify both the service name and a link alias (SERVICE:ALIAS), or just the service name.
Containers for the linked service will be reachable at a hostname identical to the alias, or the service name if no alias was specified.
Links are not required to enable services to communicate - by default, any service can reach any other service at that service’s name.


You don't daemonize a process inside a container.

The -d is usually seen in the docker run -d command, using a detached (not daemonized) mode, where the the docker container would run in the background completely detached from your current shell.

For running multiple processes in a container, the background one would be a supervisor.

Writing Dockerfile
-----------
When you issue a docker build command, the current working directory is called the build context. By default, the Dockerfile is assumed to be located here, but you can specify a different location with the file flag (-f).
