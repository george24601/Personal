#The ARG instruction lets Dockerfile authors define values that users can set at build-time using the --build-arg flag:
#This flag allows you to pass the build-time variables that are accessed like regular environment variables in the RUN instruction of the Dockerfile. Also, these values donâ€™t persist in the intermediate or final images like ENV values do.
#It is not recommended to use build-time variables for passing secrets like github keys, user credentials etc. Build-time variable values are visible to any user of the image with the docker history command.
docker build --build-arg HTTP_PROXY=http://10.20.30.2:1234 .

#-d run in background; -p publish port to host; --name assign name to a container; followed by image name. Note that -P will map any required port inside container to network

#after the image name is the command note that docker is alive as long as your command is alive, which means it shuts down right after this cmd
