A pod consists of one or more containers that are guaranteed to be co-located on the host machine and can share resources.

Each pod in Kubernetes is assigned a unique IP address within the cluster, which allows applications to use ports without the risk of conflict

A pod can define a volume, such as a local disk directory or a network disk, and expose it to the containers in the pod.

Kubernetes enables clients to attach key-value pairs called "labels" to any API object in the system, such as pods and nodes. Correspondingly, "label selectors" are queries against labels that resolve to matching objects. Labels and selectors are the primary grouping mechanism in Kubernetes, and determine the components an operation applies to.

A controller is a reconciliation loop that drives actual cluster state toward the desired cluster state

One kind of controller is a replication controller, which handles replication and scaling by running a specified number of copies of a pod across the cluster. It also handles creating replacement pods if the underlying node fails.

Other controllers that are part of the core Kubernetes system include a "DaemonSet Controller" for running exactly one pod on every machine (or some subset of machines), and a "Job Controller" for running pods that run to completion, e.g. as part of a batch job. The set of pods that a controller manages is determined by label selectors that are part of the controller’s definition

The set of pods that constitute a service are defined by a label selector. Kubernetes provides service discovery and request routing by assigning a stable IP address and DNS name to the service, and load balances traffic in a round-robin manner to network connections of that IP address among the pods matching the selector (even as failures cause the pods to move from machine to machine). By default a service is exposed inside a cluster (e.g. back end pods might be grouped into a service, with requests from the front-end pods load-balanced among them), but a service can also be exposed outside a cluster (e.g. for clients to reach frontend pods).

The components of Kubernetes can be divided into those that manage an individual node and those that are part of the control plane

Kubelet is responsible for the running state of each node, ensuring that all containers on the node are healthy. It takes care of starting, stopping, and maintaining application containers organized into pods as directed by the control plane.

Kubelet monitors the state of a pod, and if not in the desired state, the pod re-deploys to the same node. Node status is relayed every few seconds via heartbeat messages to the master. Once the master detects a node failure, the Replication Controller (note the replicationcontroller is the old way now - use Deployment and ReplicaSet now! ) observes this state change and launches pods on other healthy nodes.[citation needed]

The Kube-proxy is an implementation of a network proxy and a load balancer, and it supports the service abstraction along with other networking operation. It is responsible for routing traffic to the appropriate container based on IP and port number of the incoming request.

cAdvisor is an agent that monitors and gathers resource usage and performance metrics such as CPU, memory, file and network usage of containers on each node.

A Deployment controller provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

You describe a desired state in a Deployment object, and the Deployment controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.

Configuration files - Written in YAML or JSON, these files describe the desired state of your application in terms of Kubernetes API objects. A file can include one or more API object descriptions (manifests).

These workloads, such as Deployments and Jobs, are composed of one or more Pods.

DeploymentAn API object that manages a replicated application.  - The most common way of running X copies (Pods) of your application. Supports rolling updates to your container images.

ServiceAn API object that describes how to access applications, such as a set of Pods, and can describe ports and load-balancers.  - By itself, a Deployment can’t receive traffic. Setting up a Service is one of the simplest ways to configure a Deployment to receive and loadbalance requests. Depending on the type of Service used, these requests can come from external client apps or be limited to apps within the same cluster. A Service is tied to a specific Deployment using label  selection.

AnnotationsA key-value pair that is used to attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to objects.  - Nonidentifying metadata that you can attach to API objects, usually if you don’t intend to use them for sorting purposes. These often serve as supplementary data about an app’s deployment, such as Git SHAs, PR numbers, or URL pointers to observability dashboards.

You can run a stateful application by creating a Kubernetes Deployment and connecting it to an existing PersistentVolume using a PersistentVolumeClaim.

To make updates to your cluster’s state, you submit these files to the Kubernetes API server (kube-apiserver).

hat object data is actually stored in a highly available datastore called etcd

The standard controller processes are kube-controller-manager and cloud-controller-manager, but you can also write your own controllers as well.

However, for simplicity, set up scripts typically start all master components on the same machine, and do not run user containers on this machine. See Building High-Availability Clusters for an example multi-master-VM setup.

kube-scheduler: Component on the master that watches newly created pods that have no node assigned, and selects a node for them to run on.

Logically, each controller  is a separate process, but to reduce complexity, they are all compiled into a single binary and run in a single process.

Node Controller: Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go down.
Replication Controller: Responsible for maintaining the correct number of pods for every replication controller object in the system.
Endpoints Controller: Populates the Endpoints object (that is, joins Services & Pods).
Service Account & Token Controllers: Create default accounts and API access tokens for new namespaces.

Namespaced addon objects are created in the kube-system namespace.

A Cluster-level logging mechanism is responsible for saving container logs to a central log store with search/browsing interface.

Container Resource Monitoring records generic time-series metrics about containers in a central database, and provides a UI for browsing that data.

The spec, which you must provide, describes your desired state for the object–the characteristics that you want the object to have. The status describes the actual state of the object, and is supplied and updated by the Kubernetes system.

 the Status of the Ready condition is “Unknown” or “False” for longer than the pod-eviction-timeout, an argument is passed to the kube-controller-manager and all of the Pods on the node are scheduled for deletion by the Node Controller.

What this means is that when Kubernetes creates a node, it is really just creating an object that represents the node. After creation, Kubernetes will check whether the node is valid or not

Kubernetes will create a node object internally (the representation), and validate the node by health checking based on the metadata.name field (we assume metadata.name can be resolved). If the node is valid, i.e. all necessary services are running, it is eligible to run a pod; otherwise, it will be ignored for any cluster activity until it becomes valid. Note that Kubernetes will keep the object for the invalid node unless it is explicitly deleted by the client, and it will keep checking to see if it becomes valid.

When running in a cloud environment, whenever a node is unhealthy, the node controller asks the cloud provider if the VM for that node is still available. If not, the node controller deletes the node from its list of nodes.

A Pod represents a running process on your cluster.

A Pod encapsulates an application container (or, in some cases, multiple containers), storage resources, a unique network IP, and options that govern how the container(s) should run. A Pod represents a unit of deployment: a single instance of an application in Kubernetes, which might consist of either a single container or a small number of containers that are tightly coupled and that share resources.

Replicated Pods are usually created and managed as a group by an abstraction called a Controller.

Containers inside a Pod can communicate with one another using localhost

Restarting a container in a Pod should not be confused with restarting the Pod. The Pod itself does not run, but is an environment the containers run in and persists until it is deleted.

while it is possible to use Pod directly, it’s far more common in Kubernetes to manage your pods using a Controller.

In general, Controllers use a Pod Template that you provide to create the Pods for which it is responsible.

Subsequent changes to the template or even switching to a new template has no direct effect on the pods already created. Similarly, pods created by a replication controller may subsequently be updated directly.

When using declarative object configuration, a user operates on object configuration files stored locally, however the user does not define the operations to be taken on the files. Create, update, and delete operations are automatically detected per-object by kubectl.

StatefulSets are best suited for scenarios where replicas (Pods) need to coordinate their workloads in a strongly consistent manner. Guaranteeing an identity for each Pod helps avoid split-brain side effects in the case when a node becomes unreachable (network partition). This makes StatefulSets a great fit for distributed datastores like Cassandra or Elasticsearch.

The reload feature of Spring Cloud Kubernetes is able to trigger an application reload when a related ConfigMap or Secret change.

only configuration beans annotated with @ConfigurationProperties or @RefreshScope are reloaded. This reload level leverages the refresh feature of Spring Cloud Context.
