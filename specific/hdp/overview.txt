global RM and per-application AM.
RM and per-node slave NM form the data-computation framework. RM is the ultimate authority that arbitrates resources among al the applications in the system

AM is taksed with neogtiating reosurces from RM and working with the NM to execute and monitor the tasks

RM has 2 components: scheduler and AsM
Scedular performs no monitoring or tracking of status for the application, and offeres no guarantees about restarting failed tasks due to application failure or hardware failure

AsM is responsible for accepting job-submission, neogtiating the first container for exectuing the app specific AM and provids the service for restarting the AM container on failure

NM is the per-machine framework agaent respohnsible for containers
AM negotistas resource containers fromt he Scheduler, trackking status and monitoring for progress
