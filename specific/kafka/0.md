You can use an ELB as the bootstrap.servers, but the brokers still need to be directly accessible to the client. The ELB will be used for the initial metadata request the client makes to figure out which topic partitions are on which brokers, but after that it'll use the hostname of the server (or advertised.listeners setting if you need to customize it, which, e.g. might be necessary on EC2 instances to get the public IP of a server)

The offset commit are only used when you start a consumer or when performing rebalancing.

Consider configuring socket buffer size for consumer, at least 1MB, up to 10 MB 

### Producer performance

Sometimes 99 percentile performance can not be tuned, although turning the average helps with the number

* batch.size
* linger.ms
* max.in.flight.requests.per.connection
* acks

kafka 0.9 performance improvement:
3 ms (99th percentile)
14 ms (99.9th percentile)

How long will the producer wait before sending in order to allow more messages to get accumulated in the same batch. Normally the producer will not wait at all, and simply send all the messages that accumulated while the previous send was in progress

If sending is still slow and you are trying to understand what is going on, you will want to check if the send thread is fully utilized through jvisualsm (it is called kafka-producer-network-thread) or keep an eye on average batch size metric. If you find that you canâ€™t fill the buffer fast enough and the sender is idle, you can try adding application threads that share the same producer and increase throughput this way.

1. backup all config files (of course!)
2. All brokers are upgraded before clients, because clients from older release works with new brokers. Client incldues any application uses
Kafka producer/consumer, including but not limited to, Cmaus, Schema Registry, and REstProxy.
Speical case: client on the same node as broker!
3. supports rolling upgrades: upgrade one broker at a time, but need to upgrade ALL kafka brokers
4. upgrade SR, RP, and Camus,i.e.,all clients
