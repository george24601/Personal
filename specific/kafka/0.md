The Kafka Consumer origin reads data from a single topic in an Apache Kafka cluster. To use multiple threads to read from multiple topics, use the Kafka Multitopic Consumer.

When the consumer group and topic combination does not have a previously stored offset, the Kafka Consumer origin by default receives messages sent to the topic after the pipeline starts, processing data from all partitions and ignoring any existing messages in the topic.

The Kafka Consumer origin uses the following Kafka configuration properties. The origin ignores user-defined values for these properties:
auto.commit.enable
group.id
zookeeper.connect

This situation happens because of offsets expiration. There are two parameters in kafka controlling this behaviour. First of all it is the "retention.ms" setting of consumer offsets topic. It should be equal to -1 to disable expiration of records inside that topic.

Here the ExpirationTime value makes sense. The Group Coordinator will read only unexpired records at the moment of offsets loading, i.e. now() < ExpirationTime, and these values are returned to client's offset fetch request.

offsets.retention.minutes

ExpirationTime = CommitTime + offsets.retention.minutes

Groups only works with subscription, not with assignment.

The offset commit are only used when you start a consumer or when performing rebalancing.
