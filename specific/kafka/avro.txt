encoding: length + byte array
additional union branch field in front for union types
array has a size field at the beginning as well

It encodes 1 feidl after naother, in the order they appear in the schema. No optional type(why?), so use union with null

if you want to add a type to union, you have to update the schema reader is using, otherwise, it doesnt know how to handle the new union
branch

Avro matches the fields by name, so order doesnt matter

adding a field, need a default value, so new schema can read old data
old schema reading new data is fine, just skip it

removing a field with a default value is ok, so old schema can read new data
new schema reading old data is fine, just skip it
