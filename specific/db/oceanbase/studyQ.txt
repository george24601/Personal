1. Explain how copy-on-write B tree works

2. How does active updateServer keep in sync with standby updateServer

3. How does OB decide how many paritions it uses? Is it static or dynmaic? 

6. RootTable used a virtual memory based approach, why switch it to a system table?

7. Assume each tablet block is 256M, what is the theoratical size upper bound for each user table? How do you calculate it?

8. Compare and contrast OB's location discovery with DNS model, compare and contrast it with location discovery with big table

9. Sequence of actions of migration/replication tasks

10.Consider the sequence of action when we create a new table, why do we do it that way?

11. When we delete table, why deleting its data and data inside RT is async?

12. why use ts instead of log ID when RS picks US? Any restriction/SLA on ts sync between servers?

13. what is the sequence of action when backup US replays the log? why such sequence 

14. Explain the file structure of SSTable

15. Given sequence of actiions when doing a range scan read on a single table

17. When we migrate a tablet into target chunk server, what is TabletImage, why do we need modify commit log?

18. When we do the daily merge, why do we malloc memory size of TWO macro blocks?

19. For replication and rebalancing, the scanning of CS and monitoring is done by RS. Why is that? 

20. Switching active US to backup US, why we can't do that automatically? what manual steps we need to perform?
