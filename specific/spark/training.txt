RDD: 
set of partitions 
list of dependencis on parent RDDs 
function to compute a partition given its parents 
partitioner
preferred locations for each partition

e.g. HDFS RDD
Filtered RDD
Join RDD

Dependency type: Narrow/pipeline-able
Wide/shuffle

Application:
program -> driver (RDD grpah, scheudler, block tracker, shuffle tracker) <-> culster manager <-> executor with task threads and block
managers

Scheduling:
Build DAG => scheduler split graph into stages of tasks, and submit each stage as ready -> execturos execute task, store and serve blocks

Scheduler optimization

pipelines operataions wihtin a stage
pick joins algorims based on partitioning to minimize shuffles
resue prevoiusly cached data

Task: unit of work in an execturo thread
NO map vs reduce task, each task either patitions output for shuffle, or send the output back to the driver

Shuffle write intermediate files to disk
fetched by the next stage of tasks

Performance debugging: check port 4040 or executor logs(spark/work)

Find slow stage
Find straggler (Max Duration of a task) => Check aggregatedmetrics by executor, which node is slow?
One way to avoid it is to turn on speculation, i.e., identifies slow tasks and re-lanucnshc on other nodes, of course it doesnt help against data skew

Could it be GC?
spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-XX:-PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps
check spark/work/app../[n]/stdout on executoers

Use mapPartitions and reuse objects to reduce GC impact
