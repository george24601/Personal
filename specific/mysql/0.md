One significant difference is blob types are stored in secondary storage, while varbinaries are stored inline in the row in the same way as varchars and other "simple" types.

default max_connection: 151

service_id: last bit(byte?) in the IP address + current mysql service's port # - make sure they are different on master and slave

TRUNCATE will reset the auto-incrementing column!

wait_timeout and interactive_timeout: default 8 hours, after that MySql will close the connection to recycle the resource

use `perror` to see the error log

open_files_limit: maybe too small

UNION vs UNION ALL

IN vs EXISTS: IN outer big, inner small; EXISTS outer small inner big

Avoid null check in where => may lead to FTS instead of index scan 

Use forceindex, STRAIGHT_JOIN to tweak query plan
