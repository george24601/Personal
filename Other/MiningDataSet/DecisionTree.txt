d features, each feature has a domain
Y:output variable with domain Y
D:n examples (x(i), y(i))
Task: given an input data vector x predict y
------
Consider we are at node G:
Do we continue building the tree? then which variable and which value do we
use for a split?
Or how do we make a prediction?

How to split? pick attribute & value that optimizes some crierion
Mesure how much a given attribute X tells us about the class Y

--------
Entropy: smallest possible # of bits, on aerage, per smbol, need to transmit a
stream of symbols drawn form X's distribution?

Specific conditioal entropy H(Y | X = v)
H(Y|X) = Sum Pr(X = v) H(Y | X = v)
------

Build tree level by level: each MR sp builds 1 level
mapper: # of possible splits on subset of he data => partial split -satistics
sent to reducers
drops each datapoint to find the leaf node L, whichknows the data reaching L.
and the data in left/right subtree under split S

reducer: collects all parital statistics and determins best split

master grows the tree for one level

-------
SVM vs DT
