Greedy algo and competitive ratio analysis => worst case example

------
AdWord problem

simple algo: sort on expected value
but CTR of an ad is unknown, and advertisers have limited budges and bid on multipe ads

--------
Simplified environment:
1 ad shown for each query
all advertisers have the same budget
all ads are equally likely to be clicked
value of each ad is the same

simplest algo: => competitive ratio?

balance algo: for each query, pick the advertiser with larget unspent budget, break ties arbitarrily but in a deterministic way
=> competitive ratio for 2 user case, assuming optimal solution gives full to both
-------
N advertiser case, each with budget B > N, bidding scheme:
N * B queries appear in N rounds of B queries each
Optimal: N * B: allocate round i queries to the advertiser i
balance: What is the stop condition? what is total in this case?

for large n:
ln(N - k) = ln(N) - 1 => why?
