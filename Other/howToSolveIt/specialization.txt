specializaiton: often useful in the solution of problems

Could you imagine a more accessible related problem? A more special problem? => This specialized auxilary problem is much less ambitious

Could you reuse this problem, probably with auxiliary element introduced? => reduction into this less ambitious auxilary problem

Speiclaization also useful in testing solution

"Prospective excpetions test the rule"

(
A "corner case" may or may not be gracely handled by the general case. 

Sometimes, it may be the base case of the recursion,i.e., we keep reusing the insight we gained from the special case by reducing each step into our special form
