1.
Unknown: Color of bear
From unknown: only 3- 4 choices
Condition: turn 3 times and go back to itself
From condition: Impossible to do so on a surface => so it can NOT be on a surface => it is on a sphere!
Try those colors' locations on a sphere one by one => what do you discover

2.
Condition: parralel north/south, and parallel east/west border?, with size 100 ft
No problem if it is surface => have we seen this problem before? => the previous one! => can you reuse methods in the last problem?

3.
Known: 10 pockets, 44 dollars
conditions: no two pockets have same amount

Auxillary problem: 
A.drop some conditions => how to put 44 coins in 10 pockets
B.swap unknown with known => given 10 pockets, what values of coin can you put in total, with no same amount between pockets?


4.
unknown: # of pages
known: total # of digits in those pages

Auxillary problem:
A how many digits in total for 9 pages => 45
B. how many digits in total for 100 pages => 2 *10 * 9 + A + 3
C. 1000 => notice the odd padding for 100, 1000 => insight: should count from 0 to 9 instead of 1 to 10
D. 999 => Total(0 - 99) + 1000 * 3 => notice this is REALLY close to our number

E. Counding down form 999, how many digits in total when we count down to 900?


5.
known:  72 turkeys
unknown: unit price
condition: 72 * unit price = a67.9b

from unknown:
price > 233 and price < 1344 

swap unknown and know and generate auxilary problem
we know price has 3 digits, i.e., {xyz} = x * 100 + y * 10 + z , what is the value of {xyz} * 72 in the form of x, y, z


if the price has 4 digits => first one must be 1 => we can reuse methods of the auxillary problem

6.
unknown: line layout
known: point
condition: line separating area in equal

swap unknown and known
given a line separating regular hexgaon, how to draw it?
It must pass the central

8.
unknown: location of axis and rotate angles
condition: rotate around a certain angle will make it coincide with itself

auxilary problem: 
A. drop dimension: axises on a square?  4 of them
B. drop edges: axises on a regular tretrahedron => must pass the central point of mass , look back at A, same thing applies!
insight: our axises must pass central point of mass 

Seen similar problem before? the previous problem! => so we can try points and connect it with the mass central and see if it is an axis for cube

11.
notice the symmerty?

12.
separate parts of the condition, how to split them into parts
a:suppose the first dropoff dist at D => easy to calculate the next meet up time
b: based on a), easy to get the drop off dist
c:p =0, for every distance forward, the car has to go back one
p = c, no car needed 

13.
from condition:
we know mid term is 42 and 34. Notice that the 76 gap, one is increasing, one is decreasing
85 + 84 will ignore the delta of arithemetic series

14.
notice that x are symmetric, i.e., x(1) = 2 * x(2)

17.
induction

19
Auxilary problem
n = 1
n = 2
n = 3

20
auxilary problem
1.only cents
2.only cents and nickles
3.all types, but with lower amounts
