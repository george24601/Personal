Checking result, including intermediate ones
Test by specialization
Test by dimension
Test by variation of data and see trend

check argument
avoid mere repetition, at least change order of the steps or grouping to
introduce variation
pick out weakest point of the argument and examine it first. One point is: did
you use all the data?

Can you derive the result differently?
Although this is less likely to happen to a student

Can use use the method or result for some other problems?
construct problems which can be solved with current solutions => but these problems are likely to be uninteresting
Finding a new problem both interesting and accessible is hard
One common pattern: original unknown as given and one of the original data as unknown
Others including generalization, specialization, and analogy
ceratin of its elements as variable => critical stage changes
The experience is incomplete if never had opportunity to solve a problem invented by himself!

Euclidean exposition, perfect for checking argument, often preceeds in an order opposite to the natural order
of invention. Comman problem is that precieving a plan often have different
order from carrying it out
Intutition and formal proof: verify correctness in both cases?

from unknown: a problem with similar unknown?
from data: something useful from data? This is less preferable but worth trying

If you cannot solve the proposed problem, try to solve first some related problem. Could you solve a part of the problem
