P (A|B) = P(B|A) P(A)/ P(B)

A, B don't need to be independent, as long as random is enough

N = not D

P(D|Y) = 1/ (1 + P(Y|N)P(N) / P(Y|D)P(D))

reason P(D|Y) is small: P(N)/P(D) is too big

P(Y|N)/P(Y|D) = (1 - P(X|N)) /P(Y|D), P(X|N) and P(Y|D) are too small

Suppose we do it twice

P(D| Y1 and Y2) = P(Y1 and Y2| D) P(D) / P(Y1 and Y2) = P(Y1 and Y2| D) P(D) / P(y1 and y2 | D) * P(D) + P(Y1 and Y2 | N) P(N)
