decrease then test less than 0 in loop

keep current and next for linked list traverse

"linked" 1 to n array => simulate of permutation, can use that as either stack or queue

use of 0 index to handle base case, where index is 1 to n

use invertible op to store 2 values inside one field, with base value inferred or provided

use NEXT array to condense linked list into continuous array
