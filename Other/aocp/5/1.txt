most important applications of sorting: 
togetherness
matching items in two or more files
searching for info by key value: a listing that has been sorted into alphabetic order often looks quite authoritative even when the associated numerical information has benn incorrectly computed!

stable sorting: records with equal keys should maintain relative order
internal sorting
external sorting
----
Excercise:
1.
If not, then at least one element e position is different. Consider the blocks with values = e. In both runs, e must be within the block. So the relative order between elements = e changes,i.e., sorting is not stable

2.
Reductio ad absurdum 
If sorting is unstable => no guarentee in anyway. So if sorting is stable:
Solve part of the problem:
all minor keys unique, major key unique => A, B, C same => A,B,C same as long as major key unique
non-unique majors, minor keys unique => A, C same, b is properly sorted as well, because after the first pass + second pass is stable
Introduce a theorem: 
as long as each composite key is unique, A,B,C result will be same...and discussion continues...try another direction

Reuse the previous result.Claim: 
1. A, B, and C sort things properly as long as sorting is stable
2. A, B, and C sorting themselves are stable
=> reuse the method: if all paths lead to a unique solution with same properties, then they lead to the same solution

3.

4. reuse the previous major key/minor key idea

5.
Condition:
1. if m < n, then p(m) < p(n)
2. if m != n, then one is not a prefix of another
3. size is lgn + O(lglgn)
Consider natural coding scheme: 123 vs 21 => bad! => however, notice that as long as the they are of same length, it is good
what if we map 1 to a, 2 to aa , 3 to aaa => the prefix requirment is violated! => if the p(x) is variable length, we need some special char to mark eof
Reuse previous result/method? majorkey, minor key idea:
major key: # of digits => can be in padded natual coding scheme as well => will take loglogn to track number of digits in a number
minor key: natural coding scheme
