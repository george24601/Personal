subroutine linkage:

when # of parameters is mall, often desirable to transmit them to a subroutine by having them in registers, or by storing them in fixed meory cells

or list them after the JMP instruction, the subroutine can refer to params because it knows j register setting

multiple exits

No subroutine may call on any other subroutien that is calling on it..why?

------

step 0. decide vaguely opon the general plan of attack

step 1. breaking the whole program into a small # of pieces => turns out our sketch is most likely incorrect

step 2: First working program. opposite direcction, from lowest level subroutines and do the main program last. 

step 3. reverse the direction again, studying for each subroutine all of the calls made on it

=> often a good idea to scrap everything and start over again at step 1

good start towards effective debugging is often the preparation of appropriate test data
the most effective debugging techinques seem to be those that are designed and built into the program itself => devote nealry half of their programs to facilitatin the debugging proces in the other half)
another good practice is to keep a record of every mistake made



MAX100 STJ EXIT => EXIT JMP * in program
