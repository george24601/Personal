The old five-minute rule for RAM and disk now applies to page sizes of 64 KB (334 seconds). Five minutes had been the approximate break-even interval for 1 KB in 198716 and for 8 KB in 1997.17 This trend reflects the different rates of improvement in disk-access latency and transfer bandwidth.

The five-minute break-even interval also applies to RAM and the expensive flash memory of 2007 for page sizes of 64 KB and above (365 seconds for 64 KB and 339 seconds for 256 KB). As the price premium for flash memory decreases, so does the break-even interval (146 and 136 seconds, respectively).
