## Bain's rapid model
R – Recommend
A – Agree
P – Perform
I – Input
D – Decide


R = Responsible: A person actually doing the work. You can have multiple “R” entries for a task. This means more than one person does the work.

A = Accountable: The person who will be ultimately held accountable for the work. Should have only one person

C = Consulted: A person who should be consulted for their opinion. These people may be outside of your team.
Those whose opinions are sought, typically subject matter experts; and with whom there is two-way communication
"C" means that the person doesn’t contribute to doing the work. Instead, you just ask for their input and feedback.

I = Informed: A person who should be informed of the outcome or progress of the work, but they don’t really get a say in how the work is done
Those who are kept up-to-date on progress, often only on completion of the task or deliverable; and with whom there is just one-way communication

 Outside of the AR exception, it is generally recommended that each role in the project or process for each task receive, at most, just one of the participation types. 

Support
Resources allocated to responsible. Unlike consulted, who may provide input to the task, support helps complete the task. Resources which play a supporting role in implementation.

Quality Review
Those who check whether the product meets the quality requirements.

Out of the loop (or omitted)
Designating individuals or groups who are specifically not part of the task. Specifying that a resource does not participate can be as beneficial to a task's completion as specifying those who do participate.

 

PACSI
This is a version very useful to organizations where the output of activities under the accountability of a single person/function can be reviewed and vetoed by multiple stakeholders, due to the collaborative nature of the culture.
Perform
The person/function carrying out the activity.
Accountable
The person/function ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and often the one who delegates the work to the performer.
Control
The person/function reviewing the result of the activity. He or she has a right of veto; his or her advice is binding.
Suggest
The person/function consulted to give advice based upon recognized expertise. The advice is non-binding.
Informed
The person/function who must be informed of the result of the activity.
