tech vs customer/analyst/domain expoert communication: either side dominates => project loses

Story: 1. description for planning and reminder, functionality valued by USER
  2. conversations about the story as details
  3. tests that can be used to determin when a story is complete
  4. needs to be done by CUSTOMER, and NOT in tech jargons

When a story is too large it becomes epics

But we do not break down story into every last detail. Talk with customer about details when details become important. 

But story is not contract, test is!

customer team: tests, PM, real users (as comprehensive as possible), interaction designers
They are visioneris, and write story in a story writing workshop 

velocity: how much work a developer can do in an iteration

customer team can make corrections before the start of each iteration

identify user roels and personas before writing stories

need reasonable representation of the devs and customers in the init BS session, where each one comes up with new roles as much as you can,
and categorize them => at least cover MVP case

also need to rip unimportant role cards for roles that are unimportant to the success of the system

minimal metrics for user:
1. use frequency
2. expertise with the domain
3. level of proficiency with the software being developed
4. general goal for using the software

persona: make sure enough market and demo research done

extreme character: unlikely users for the systems, to lead to stories that you may miss
try not to include dependency between stories

When as much detail is added , the dicussions abou the story ar emuch morelikely to feel concrete and real. This can lead to the mistaken belief that the story reflects all details

details that been determined through conversations become tests

many stories are evaluated by purchasers than users

variate tech-dev focused term into true user-story,i.e., user-value

if dev does not have the domain knowledge, talk to the user to figure out

Bug reports and user interface changes often are too small for a story => combine them to a bigger one

responsible for helping the customer write stories that are promises to converse rather than detailed specifications

There is one more thing worth mentioning about breaking up user stories that many teams get wrong. When slicing stories, they should be sliced vertically, rather than horizontally.

Formal structures like tech leads can serve to make this even worse if the domains are particularly small. I tend to prefer establishing DRIs for sub-priorities with a team. The DRI is responsible for a sub-priority or sub-component but it's not their identity; they're still expected to work on other stuff on the team and to focus their energies on whatever matters most to the team as a whole. (Important to set expectations)

By creating vertically-sliced stories, the team has a clear picture of what specific tasks need to be completed to add value for the end-user, and the tasks are more discrete and easier to keep track of.

If team members are feeling overwhelmed then you've gone too far. Don't throw your intern to the sharks
