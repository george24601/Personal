The core principles you should focus on as a product manager revolves around product usage, customer-centric design (especially user experience), competitive offerings, pricing, market share and industry trends.

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
Customer Conversion Rate (CCR)
Repurchase Rate (RR)
Daily Active Users (DAU)
Feature Usage (FU, yes that’s really the abbreviation)
User Churn (UC)
Net Promoter Score (NPS)
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

, the number one priority for your data should be finding the overall “product-market fit.” Usage data (like events) is a good place to start for this, but you absolutely need to include customer feedback. One manager I talked to said that no observational usage data has ever stacked up to the insight she gains from picking up the phone and talking to 10 customers directly. As a general rule I agree with her but it’s not just because conversations have magical power (though they do) it’s because you probably haven’t setup formal tests for evaluating the usage data.



 Testing is not something you should take lightly though, and if the consequences of a test outcome are big, say because it requires a large amount of development costs or scrapping a part of your product roadmap, then you really need to ensure your tests are valid and you should conduct the test multiple times to check you get consistent results.


It’s choosing a few key metrics to keep an eye on, spend less time tracking, and more time acting upon the found data.

Depending on what your objective is – attracting a new customer segment, improving popularity with users, getting ideas for new features – you need to choose the right metrics.

Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
These metrics measure a product’s total revenue in one month

Average revenue per user (ARPU) allows you to count the revenue generated per user monthly or annually.

There are two types of ARPU: per new account and per existing account. ARPU per new account refers to metrics based on new accounts appearing after the subscription plan or product price was changed. ARPU per existing account involves the data from accounts established before the price change.

Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) * Average customer lifetime = CLTV

Sales & marketing spendings for a period of time / total # of customers generated for a period of time = CAC

Daily Active User/Monthly Active User ratio
DAU/MAU of 20 percent is considered a good sign, while 50+ percent indicates extreme success

Customer retention rate (CRR) is the percentage of customers who stayed with the company after a certain time period

According to the Product Benchmarks Report by Mixpanel, the average CRR for most software products is below 20 percent over 8 weeks

It can be tracked with statistics that display the number of logins or site visits. This KPI reveals the popularity of a product – if the audience engages with it again and again. Unlike traffic or session duration, the number of sessions per user shows an average for a particular group of people in some time period.

This KPI seems similar to the previous one, but it tracks not just how many times a user opened an app. It displays which actions a user made and which feature(s) they used while using the app.
