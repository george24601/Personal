# Objective 

1. In a single sentence, qualitative goal

2. Should be inspirational, not conform to status quo or describe business as usual

3. the goal should be time bound, but not too long

4. Try setting only one


# Key Results

1. most often three

2. quantitative metrics to meature if objective has been reached by the end of the period, should include evidence of completion

3. difficult but not impossible, i.e., 50% of failing, as if it is truly random

4. something happened because of something you did => describe impacts instead of activities

5. can be time-related if not by default end of the whole period

6. You always get what you measure, so focus on the right incentives

7. Don't give different weights to key results even though they contribute different level of values=> it is about tendency, not perfection


1. much of the value in OKRs comes from the conversation on what matters

2. baking OKR into weekly meetings and weekly status mail

3. DO NOT CHANCE OKR, let it fail and set better goal next time

4.  If you can't keep on track longer than a week. Then you are not ready for OKR yet. This is especailly true for startups. OKR should be reviewed weekly or biweekly to ensure focus and progress

5. When setting objectives, Google often starts with the organizational OKRs and aligns priorities using three to five objectives (more can over-extend teams) with about three key results for each objective.

#Goodhart's law
When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes

Any statistical relationship will break down when used for policy purposes

When someone distorts decisions in order to improve the performance measure, they often surrogate, coming to believe that the measure is a better measure of true performance than it really is.

the more quantitative social indicator used for social decision-making is subjected to corruption pressure and liable to distort and damage social processes it meant to monitor

it is naive to try to predict the effects of a change in economic policy entirely on the basis of relationships observed in historical data, especially highly aggregated historical data

One of the first steps in solving a problem — data science or otherwise — is determining the right measure to gauge success. When we want to objectively find the best solution, we should recall the concept of Goodhart’s Law and realize that rather than using a single number, the best assessment is usually a set of measurements. By choosing multiple metrics, we can design a solution without the unintended consequences that occur when optimizing for a narrow objective.
