Arms crossed => not open

get rid of conversation filters, but not putting your hands in pockets, pause think, and then answer, be comforatble with silent
=> slow dowm!
lean forward during your coomunication, but AVOID extreme body languages -  make large hand movements or shake heads violently

body language can infer comforness, but not much else.

we allow access to our torso when comfortable

Note where legs and feet are pointing -> crossed legs while standing mean interest!

However, it is important to know baseline => look out for what is out of ordinary

Need to figure right mode of communication with each coworker

ask open-ended question to buy more time

BRIEF for email: background, reasion, information (bullet poitns), End (what notes you want ot finish), Follow-up(image what questions the other side will ask)

If they don't trust you, they are not going to say anything

Open with somthing small and innocous, before your true question, 

shut up so other people move onto topics they want to talk about

notice the different style between venter and explainer

set aside your judgment and withhold blame and criticism in order to fully understand them

Avoid:
1. Judging the other persion
2. Giving solutions or UNWANTED advice
3. Avoiding concerns of others

In effective learning:
Identifying rather than empathising
sympathy is not the same as empathy, you sympathise when you feel sorry for the experiences of another, to empathise is to put yourself in the position of the other person
giving advice without understanding the scenario
sudden change in topic

You can't keep saying "uh-huh" or "yes" for too long without it sounding false.

Avoid:
1. yes or no questions. This means prefer open-end questions
2. limited possibilities => however useful for checking facts
3. negative questions => don't demotivate people

Prefer:
1. open-end questions
2. dive deeply into details
3. what if questions
4. opposite of what you really like to lure out hidden prejudice

prefer active to passive voice

avoid jargen!
