### Chapter 16: No Silver Bullet—Essence and Accident in Software Engineering

A prototype software system is one that simulates the important interfaces and performs the main functions of the intended system, while not being necessarily bound by the same hardware speed, size, or cost constraints. Prototypes typically perform the mainline tasks of the application, but make no attempt to handle the exceptions, respond correctly to invalid inputs, abort cleanly, etc. The purpose of the prototype is to make real the conceptual structure specified, so that the client can test it for consistency and usability.

7.7 Properly structuring the on-going documentation from the beginning "molds later writing into segments that fit into that structure" and will improve the product manuals.

11.8 Both the actual need and the user's perception of that need will change as programs are built; tested, and used.

11.9 The tractability and the invisibility of the software product expose its builders (exceptionally) to perpetual changes in requirements.

13.7 Sometimes one has to go back, scrap a high level, and start over.

15.5 Most documentation fails in giving too little overview. Stand way back and zoom in slowly. (???)

### Chapter 19. The Mythical Man-Month after 20 Years


The "second" system in Chapter 11 is the second try at building what should be the first system to be fielded. It is built under all the schedule, talent, and ignorance constraints that characterize new projects—the constraints that exert a slimness discipline.

One may well, therefore, iterate through two or more architecture-implementation design cycles before realizing anything as code.

The top performers' space is quieter, more private, better protected against interruption, and there is more of it. . . . Does it really matter to you . . . whether quiet, space, and privacy help your current people to do better work or [alternatively] help you to attract and keep better people?
