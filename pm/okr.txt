objective: 
In a single sentence, qualitative goal
Should be inspirational, not conform to status quo or describe business as usual
the goal should be time bound, but not too long
Try setting only one


key results: 
most often three,  
quantitative metrics to meature if objective has been reached by the end of the period, should incolude evidence of completion
difficult but not impossible, i.e., 50% of failing, as if it is truly random
something happened because of something you did => describe impacts instead of activities
can be time-related if not by default end of the whole period
You always get what you measure, so focus on the right incentives
Don't give different weights to KRs even though they contribute different level of values=> it is about tendency, not perfection


much of the value in OKRs comes from the conversation on what matters
baking OKR into weekly meetings and weekly status mail
DO NOT CHANCE OKR, let it fail and set better goal next time
staring with one OKR per 
If you can't keep on track longer than a week. Then you are not ready for OKR yet. This is especailly true for startups
OKR should be reviewed weekly or biweekly to ensure focus.

When setting objectives, Google often starts with the organizational OKRs and aligns priorities using three to five objectives with about three key results for each objective.

Pick just three to five objectives - more can lead to over-extended teams and a diffusion of effort. Determine around three key results per objectives

Key results should describe outcomes, not activities. Instead, describe the impact of these activities, e.g., “publish customer service satisfaction levels by March 7th” rather than “assess customer service satisfaction.”

Prior to assigning a final grade, it can be helpful to have a mid-quarter check-in for all levels of OKRs to give both individuals and teams a sense of where they are. An end of quarter check-in can be used to prepare ahead of the final grading
