A good negotiator knows that he/she needs to always be ready for surprises. A great negotiator, on the other hand, uses a specific set of skills to reveal the surprises they are certain to exist.

Great negotiators question assumptions and are thus open to all possibilities and are more intellectually agile to fluid situations.

People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become overwhelmed by the voices in their head. But the truth is, negotiation isn’t a battle; it is an act of discovery. The objective is to uncover as much information as is available.

You need to understand what the other party actually needs and get them feeling safe enough to talk about what they really want. Negotiation begins with listening to the other party, validating their concerns and emotions, building trust and creating a safety net that allows for real conversations.

Trying to speed up the negotiation process is a mistake that many negotiators make. The problem with this is that, if you’re in too much of a hurry, it can make the other party feel like they’re not being heard, and you risk to undermine the rapport and trust that you’ve tried to build.

The direct/assertive voice: This should be used as rarely as possible because this has the potential to create pushback.

The late-night FM DJ voice: Basically, keep it calm and slow. Use this selectively to make a point. When done properly, the late-night FM DJ voice has the power to create an aura of authority and trust without making the other party defensive.

The playful/positive voice: This should be your default voice.  It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging.

Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said because we fear what is different and find comfort in similarity. Using mirroring encourages the other party to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your party some time, and eventually reveal their strategy.

The five-step process according to the author to own any negotiation process is:

Use the late-night FM DJ voice; - Calm and slow, build trustworthiness
Start with phrases like, “I’m sorry…”;
Mirror;
Use silence effectively;
and Repeat.

Once you’ve spotted an emotion you want to highlight, the next step is to label it aloud. Labels can be phrased as statements or questions. Labels almost always begin with the following phrases:

“It seems like…”
“It looks like…”
“It sounds like…”
PAUSE to let the label sink in, wait 4 secs
People’s emotions have two levels. A “presenting” behavior, which is the part above the surface that one can see and hear; and the “underlying” feeling which is the motivation behind the behavior.

Great negotiators address those underlying emotions by labeling. Labeling negatives diffuse them, and labeling positives reinforce them. Labeling helps de-escalate situations because it acknowledges the other party’s feelings rather than continuing to act them out.

Pushing for a hard “Yes” doesn’t get you any closer to a victory. It only irks the other party. Contrary to popular belief, “No” is the start of the negotiation, not the end of it.

In a negotiation scenario, “No” provides a great opportunity for you and the other party to clarify what you really want by eliminating what you don’t want.

If you’re trying to sell something, don’t start with “Do you have a few minutes to talk?” Instead ask, “Is now a bad time to talk?” Either you get “Yes, it is a bad time” followed by a good time or a request to go away, or you get “No, it’s not” and total focus.

Let the other side say “No” makes the speaker feel safe, secure, and in control, so trigger it

If a potential business partner is ignoring you, contact them with a clear and concise “No”-oriented question that suggests that you are ready to walk away. “Have you given up on this project?” works wonders.

When you talk numbers, use odd ones: Numbers that end in a ‘0’ tend to feel like placeholders. But any arbitrary number you throw out that sounds less rounded— like say, $78,435—feels like a figure that you came to as a result of a thoughtful calculation.

The first time they agree to something, that’s the first instance. For the second instance, you can label or summarize what they said so they answer, “That’s right.” And the third instance could be a calibrated “How” or “What” question about implementation, something like “What do you see as being the most difficult thing to get around?”


The Ackerman Model is an offer-counteroffer method. The six-step process is:

Set your target price (your goal).
Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price.
Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent).
Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “No” to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer.
When calculating the final amount, use precise, non-round numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight.
On your final number, throw in a non-monetary item (that they probably don’t want) to show you’re at your limit.

SLOW IT DOWN

Remove I understand from your vocabulary - NEVER USE IT


(Good)That is right vs (Bad)Yes, you are right

1.We just want what is fair - OK I apologize, let's go back to where the fair part begins
2.We've given you a fair offer - how do you provide evidence to support it?
3. I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly, so stop me at any time if you feel i am being unfair, and we will fix it

Calibrated questions: 
avoid questions that can be answered with Yes or tiny piece of information
Don't use Can Is, Are, Do, Does

I'll try you are right - I plan to fail

Rule of Three:
1. Get them to give me commitment
2. Label + summerize - get a That's right
3. How or What on implementation, what is the success measure

Liars: longer words, rarer I(him,her,it, one), more complex sentences

I, me, my - less importatnt in decision makint
we, they, them - actual decision maker leaving options open
Use the other side's own name! They want to be called! ("What is the Yanda discount!")

When something doesn't make sense, there is an oppurtunity, dig in!

To identify behind-the-table deal killers:
1. How does this affect rest of the team?
2. HOw on board are the people not on this call?
3. What do you colleages see as their main challenge in this area

Negotiation is the heart of collaboration, and is what makes conflict potentially meaningful and productive for all parties.

The goal is to make your counterparts feel safe enough to talk about what they want, and then move on to identify what they actually need.

Going too fast makes people feel as if they're not being heard, thereby undermining all the rapport and trust that we've built.

To deal with forceful type A personalities, use the late-night FM DJ voice, start with "I'm sorry," mirror, sit in silence, and repeat.

Then label it aloud with "It seems/sounds/looks like..." Don't use "I," which makes you seem self-interested, and makes you take personal responsibility for what follows.

If the other party is not listening, antagonize them into "no" by mislabeling their emotions or desires, or by asking what they don't want.
If despite all your efforts, the other party won't say "no," then they are indecisive, confused, or have a hidden agenda. Walk away.
If your emails are being ignored, provoke a "no" with the one sentence email: "Have you given up on this project?"

If your adversaries say "you're right," then they won't own the conclusion. Their behavior won't change.
"You're right," like "yes," is a social lubricant that is not in any way a substitute for real understanding between two parties.

Splitting the difference, or a "win-win approach," at best satisfies neither side, and at worst fails against an adversary with a win-lose approach.
We don't compromise because it's right, but because it's easy and we save face. Distilled to its essence, we compromise because it's safe.
Never split the difference. Creative solutions are almost always preceded by some risk, annoyance, confusion, or conflict.

The phrase "We just want what's fair" destabilizes the other side. Instead of conceding irrationally, apologize, and offer to go back to where the unfairness began and fix things.
The phrase "We've given you a fair offer" is nefarious. Mirror with "Fair?" and label with "It seems like you're ready to provide evidence to support that."
The phrase "I want you to feel like you're being treated fairly at all times. Please stop me at any time if you feel like you're being treated unfairly, and we'll address it" is empowering.

Calibrated questions avoid "can," "is," "are," "do," or "does," which can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no."
Start questions with "what" and "how." "Who," "when," and "where" will cause your counterpart to share a fact without thinking. "Why" can sound accusatory.

A well-designed calibrated question implies that you need the other party's intelligence to overcome the problem, which appeals to very aggressive or egotistical types.

"How will we know when we're on track?" and "How will we address things if we find we're off track" push counterparts to think they're defining success their way.
If you hear "you're right" or "I'll try," dive back in with calibrated "how" questions until you get a "that's right."


Analyst: doesn't like calibrated questions


Accommodators value most the building of a relationship. They value the time communicating and want a win-win.
If your counterpart is an accommodator, ask calibrated questions to translate their talk into action.
As an accommodator, do not sacrifice your objections, and beware of excessive chitchat, especially if your counterpart is one as well.
Assertives believe time is money. Their self image is linked to getting things done, and getting things perfect isn't paramount.
Focus on what assertives have to say, because until they are convinced you understand them, they won't listen to your point of view.
Mirrors, calibrated questions, labels, and summaries work well with assertives, who see every silence as an opportunity to speak more.
Get a that's right
Be extra-careful with reciprocity - they will ask too much
How to get them back: Any invitation to re-engage
If they give up something, they are counting seconds until they get something equal or more



Anger on your part shows passion, but reduces your counterpart's resources for other cognitive activity, thereby reducing your gains.

De-escalate by suggesting a time-out. Neither party is hostage to a bad situation, and they'll regain a sense of agency and power.

Email is a bad medium for finding Black Swans: counterparts have time to think and re-center themselves, and you can'tread non-verbal parts of a response.
Get face time with your counterpart, and hunt for Black Swans at the fringes and ends of meetings, where people let their guard down.


Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. We fear what’s different and are drawn to what’s similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarity, which facilitates bonding. Use mirrors to encourage the other side to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your side time to regroup, and encourage your counterparts to reveal their strategy.

By repeating back what people say, your counterpart will inevitably elaborate on what was just said and sustain the process of connecting.

To get your own way without confrontation, follow five simple steps:

Use the late-night FM DJ voice;
Start with “I’m sorry …”;
Mirror;
Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart; and
Repeat.
