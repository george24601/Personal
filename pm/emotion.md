If the emotion is appropriate to the situation and helps you feel better, there’s no need to worry about changing the way you handle things.

You could express your frustration in other ways that allow you to release those angry feelings, or instead try to find a way to calm yourself down.

Avoid circumstances that trigger unwanted emotions. If you know that you're most likely to get angry when you’re in a hurry (and you become angry when others force you to wait), then don’t leave things for the last minute.

Perhaps the emotion you’re trying to reduce is disappointment. You’re always hoping, for example, to serve the “perfect” meal for friends and family, but invariably something goes wrong because you’ve aimed too high. Modify the situation by finding recipes that are within your range of ability so that you can pull off the meal.

Your heart may be beating out a steady drumroll of unpleasant sensations when you’re made to be anxious or angry. Take deep breaths and perhaps close your eyes in order to calm yourself down. Similarly, if you can’t stop laughing when everyone else seems serious or sad, gather your inner resources and force yourself at least to change your facial expression if not your mood.


Tune in

notice when these instances happen. Be ready to be pen, wiling, and vulnerable, as you take the first big first step in emotional wellness by paying attention to your sincere feelings.

Hunt for the triggers that may have contributed to your feelings.

A tip to emotional management is to step out of your zone in order to gain perspective. Fast forward from that moment and consider what may happen. What are the consequences of our actions? Are we solely affected or do our emotional reactions spark others’ as well? In that future-oriented view, consider what matters to you in that moment.  Being able to gain perspective and connect to our ultimate values helps us to attune our thoughts and feelings when we return to the present moment.

In social situations, especially conflicts, we often broadcast our own narrative louder than others. Putting ourselves on mute while we increase the volume of those around us can be a tactful practice in empathy and can assist us in broadening our perspectives.

When mildly irritated, without monitoring your emotions, this sentiment can easily grow to agitation, frustration, anger, and even rage. What to do about this sudden bad crowd? Positive emotions tend to have a similar habit, and can be just as powerful. Adjust the brightness to focus on welcome emotions. Focus on gratitude in the present moment to evoke related feelings of happiness and fulfillment.

Two helpful ways to assist in maintaining a mindful minute, particularly when paired, are (1) deep breathing, and (2) counting. Breathing in through your nose count slowly to five. During this time focus on the changes in your body as an effect of your breathing; you may see your lungs expand, your shoulders broaden, and your abdomen may move. Hold for a moment and then exhale, counting backwards from five, still maintaining focus on your breath as it travels through your body. Even though it is brief, this mindfulness technique can assist you in regaining your equilibrium when becoming emotionally heightened.

When pausing and perspective may not be enough, it is helpful to be proactive in knowing when to stop yourself. A key way to press stop is to remove yourself from the situation, change the environment or switch your focus if possible. Are you able to leave the office? Go for a walk? Have a glass of water? Shifting your focus can give you the ability to reduce emotional arousal and regain clarity, functioning, and productivity.

Take time to disconnect from the world and reconnect with your mind, heart, and soul. Free of distractions, turning off the noise of the world and its obligations allows you to reduce the smog that may be clouding your emotional awareness and management.

select the option of auto-pilot instead, relinquishing you from the need to use the potentially time-consuming and energy-draining controls noted above. You are brave to embark on this path. It is not an easy one, but it will prove worthwhile in the end.

But when we act on our emotions too quickly, or we act on the wrong kinds of emotions, we often make decisions that we later lament.

Negative emotions, like rage, envy or bitterness, tend to spiral out of control, especially immediately after they’ve been triggered

Reacting immediately to emotional triggers can be an immense mistake. It is guaranteed that you’ll say or do something you’ll later regret.

Most of the time, simply the way you are thinking about the situation is causing you to feel the way you do. Another huge reason why we feel negative emotions is because our values are not present in that moment or being respected. Remember: discover the ‘why.’

Sometimes by simply understanding why you feel a certain way at a certain time, your emotions will start to diminish because understanding always leads to calming.

but the problem is that our bodies and minds aren’t particularly good at discerning between the threats presented by not getting your way on the project plan and, say, being chased down by a bear.

If your body goes into “fight or flight” mode or what Dan Goleman called “amygdala hijack,” you may lose access to the prefrontal cortex, the part of your brain responsible for rational thinking. And making rational decisions is precisely what you need to do in a difficult conversation. Not only are you losing the ability to think clearly but chances are your counterpart notices the signs of stress — your face turning red, the pace of your speech speeding up — and, because of mirror neurons that cause us to “catch” the emotions of another person, your colleague is likely to start feeling the same way.

So when you start noticing yourself getting tense, try to focus on breathing. Notice the sensation of air coming in and out of your lungs. Feel it pass through your nostrils or down the back of your throat. This will take your attention off the physical signs of panic and keep you centered

Sitting still when you’re having a difficult conversation can make the emotions build up rather than dissipate. Experts say that standing up and walking around helps to activate the thinking part of your brain.

She recommends coming up with a phrase that you can repeat to yourself to remind you to stay calm. Some of her clients have found “Go to neutral” to be a helpful prompt. You can also try “This isn’t about me,” “This will pass,” or “This is about the business.”

“the attention you give your thoughts and feelings crowds your mind; there’s no room to examine them,” she says. To distance yourself from the feeling, label it. “Call a thought a thought and an emotion an emotion,” says David. He is so wrong about that and it’s making me mad becomes I’m having the thought that my coworker is wrong, and I’m feeling anger. Labeling like this allows you to see your thoughts and feelings for what they are: “transient sources of data that may or may not prove helpful.”

Be sure to give a neutral reason for why you want to stand up and pause the conversation — the last thing you want is for your counterpart to think that things are going so badly you’re desperate to escape.

So you may be in a situation where you just need to let the other person vent. That’s usually easier said than done though. It’s hard not to yell back when you’re being attacked, but that’s not going to help.

We found that perpetrating abusive behaviors, such as starting an argument with, making fun of, or ignoring a direct report made leaders feel guilty, which in turn prompted leaders to pay more attention to the person and to engage in two types of behavior. One of these types was supportive, such as showing concern for the abused followers and looking out for their welfare, while the other was directive, such as clarifying work goals and role expectations, maintaining open channels of communication, and helping abused followers excel.
