# Scenario:  You are in a position of authority and need to issue an unpopular decision from your supervisor  

Options 

1. just issue the decision, espeicially ones applying to everyone and/or the decision is from your supervisor 
2. Ask people to give feedback directly to the issuser, most likely your supervisor.

# Scenario: Sudden bad news/crisis

Options: 

1. From competitors, find their weakness to exchange, or escalate that into a common/general problem to shift focus
2. From public/users, transparent on all known
3. Product, slient/fallback/stay low.

Note often these things appear together. Need to identify which is the main one

# Scenario: authority issues a decision you deemed incorrect

1. You may disagree, but have to commit. Otherwise, people may use the same reason to reject your decision
2. However, you may do something at execution level,e.g., commit by doing small scale PoC and let facts speak.


# Scenario: rejected by the authority in front of your subordinates

1. Know that the authority often has a different context - thus, complaining only shows that you are narrow minded
2. One way is to not talk about that, and let time dilute the effect

# Scenario: sudden incidents need to address

1. Need to keep the main objectives in mind all the time - can put such accidents on low priority
2. when handling such incidents, try reporting to your superior unless explicitly told so, unless it is REALLY special time. This also makes authority FEELS safe.
3. If incidents from external, focus on that as it brings more impact. If it is internal, emphasize on it will give a (false) impression of internal disorganization

# Scenario: got blamed for things out of your scope

1. explain that not within your scope
2. offer your solution - put more emphasis on what you can do to help solve the problem.


### difficult talk

If you expect the discussion to go poorly, it will be clear during the conversation itself. Positive visioning is helpful in any endeavor, and difficult conversations are no different. Before the conversation, think about your ideal outcome. It’s very possible that the conversation will go much better than you initially thought.

You may want to write down your talking points beforehand, but preparing an entire script is unreasonable. It’s unlikely that the conversation will go exactly as planned. A script could create a situation where you are delivering a monologue instead of finding a solution together through dialogue.

It’s important that you tell the truth during the conversation, but it’s equally important that you use language that your counterpart will be receptive to. Being either too blunt or too vague decreases your chances of achieving your desired result.

Slowing down helps you to be more conscious about what you are saying. If you can feel yourself getting defensive or reactive, pause and take a breath.

Place both feet on the floor and put your hands on your knees. Face the person you’re talking with.

### Culture

a critical feature of effective complex organisations is that they make people do all the jobs.

I was shocked to discover that it was not considered standard to have the overall manager personally vet new hires.

Training is the highest leverage activity a manager can do to increase the output of an organization.  Don’t leave training to outsiders, do it yourself.

never complain your company or your team's task in front your subordinates - and stop the complaints at you! However, it is OK to complain to your boss! 

### Building relationship

1. Authority care most what you can contribute in the future
2. To affect opinions of people, not only the person himself, but also whoever that can directly affect the said person too. Build common interest between the people around the authority
4. Easier to build new relationship than saving old relationship
5. Can be a leader or follower regardless of current status and self-esteem
6. Sacrifice short term interest, and move to a different position to avoid contraversy and power struggle

When got assigned by the higher-up, commit even if you disagreee. When given new power/benefit, may not need to APPEAR greedy.

### commanded by bosses's boss directly
1. Should obey the command
2. explain current context including boss's direction
3. let the boss know the change and command as soon as time permits
