# Scenario:  You are in a position of authority and need to issue an unpopular decision from your supervisor  

Options 

1. just issue the decision, espeicially ones applying to everyone and/or the decision is from your supervisor 

2. Ask people to give feedback directly to the issuser, most likely your supervisor.


# Building relationship

1. Authority care most what you can contribute in the future

2. To affect opinions of people, not only the person himself, but also whoever that can directly affect the said person too. Build common interest between the people around the authority

4. Easier to build new relationship than saving old relationship

5. Can be a leader or follower regardless of current status and self-esteem

6. Sacrifice short term interest, and move to a different position to avoid contraversy and power struggle


# Scenario: Sudden bad news/crisis

Options: 

1. From competitors, find their weakness to exchange, or escalate that into a common/general problem to shift focus

2. From public/users, transparent on all known

3. Product, slient/fallback/stay low.

Note often these things appear together. Need to identify which is the main one

# Scenario: authority issues a decision you deemed incorrect

1. You may disagree, but have to commit. Otherwise, people may use the same reason to reject your decision

2. However, you may do something at execution level,e.g., commit by doing small scale PoC and let facts speak.


# Scenario: rejected by the authority in front of your subordinates

1. Know that the authority often has a different context - thus, complaining only shows that you are narrow minded

2. One way is to not talk about that, and let time dilute the effect

# Scenario: sudden incidents need to address

1. Need to keep the main objectives in mind all the time - can put such accidents on low priority

2. when handling such incidents, try reporting to your superior unless explicitly told so, unless it is REALLY special time. This also makes authority FEELS safe.

3. If incidents from external, focus on that as it brings more impact. If it is internal, emphasize on it will give a (false) impression of internal disorganization
