I tend to look at the Design Document as providing more of a technical overview and the Plan as a second document which includes assumptions, justifications, and the like necessary for meeting the customer's requirements.

If you have a three-document model:

- Design - the picture that describes the end result (it often doesn't include product names, but might in some cases)

- Plan - a milestone-level view of how that design will get accomplished (no commands are included, but product names and the processes selected might very well be documented)

- Implementation - a step-by-step list of what to do which could be used to reproduce the work, possibly by someone who isnâ€™t familiar with the design or plan.

Another way of thinking of it might be this:

- A design is the type of document a company might produce to be sent off for bidding (i.e., the customer might produce)

- A plan is individual -- the order and way you solve and verify your solution might be different from someone else, but

- If you just provide implementation steps without the plan, how will you know you did the job?

On that note, consider adding specialized reviewers (such as SREs and security engineers) for specific aspects of the design.
