Culture is key:

- People have to be of the mindset that meetings are short and purposeful. Nobody is in the meeting because they are the boss, or forced to join in order to soak up the atmosphere. (Both of those are real things, somehow).

- People exercise judgement in deciding how many people to write to: either DM, or 3-way, or dump it in a public channel.

- Most work is async by far. People post what they're up to, and other people will go and bother them if they're doing something relevant.

100% on self starters. Micromanagers or workers that require great oversight aren't going to work.

That sounds like how all my best managers have worked, whether on site or remote. Their job is to facilitate your work, not control it.

'Managing' programmers in general is hard enough, managing remote team in nigh iimpossible so don't do it, just remove the obvious roadblock, be aware of what everyone is up to (roughly) and don't interrupt, if not needed. I dare say the daily standups are not needed - just read the commits to see what's already happened and send an email or a wiki page to edit plan for next week,

requiring 5x the process when working as a remote team

Innovation is not a group activity, it is always the work of a single individual's creativity. You might think otherwise, that brainstorming and bouncing ideas off each other is important, but you'd be wrong.

“International team” where expectation and default cultural bias are major issues.

“systemized communication and expectations made explicit”.

This can be as simple as: “We do check-ins every morning…” “Please before you do X always do Y…” These simple explicit agreements allow other people to expect those actions to happen and avoid unnecessary communication loops.

You need to act like a larger company than you actually are. you need to be stricter about best practices, and you will run into communication problems… a lot of them.

These communication problems are often what people complain about when they discuss if they should switch to remote teams or hire remote engineers.

Similarly problematic are satellite offices. The bridge between the offices has 5x communication needs, but people in each office act like co-located teams. Unless the offices can work mostly autonomously, this communication bridge between them will suffer.

If you need a small office, make sure people in it don’t have a critical mass in projects and communicate remote-friendly.

Ask remote teams how long their people stayed with them. It’s years longer than in co-located companies.

“Innovation” is more natural in person. It’s better when even the quiet person in the back can pick up a marker and explain something.

But once you agree on something it’s about individual performance… This is usually easier remote.

Iteration easier remote
Innovation easier in person
So even if you work remotely, you will need to define how often you want to meet. I recommend once per quarter or twice per year as a team and whenever required by the individual project teams.

In remote teams, you need to set up in a way people can be as autonomously as they need. Autonomously doesn’t mean “left alone” it means “be able to run alone” (when needed).

How can you increase confidence? (speed comes through confidence!)

Have strong onboarding documents and employee handbooks
Have new employees improve those onboarding documents

Wait for problems before you introduce solutions (esp. processes or infrastructure)
