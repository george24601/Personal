It’s best to pause before crying foul, however. This is some of the most hazardous terrain in office politics.

Attempted workarounds by junior employees typically fail.

Sometimes it’s best for a manager to take ownership of an idea, to improve the chances that the idea will be taken seriously by decision makers, says Marc Prosser, co-founder of FitSmallBusiness, a New York-based digital business publication.

Don’t react impulsively, says Robert Hellmann, president of a New York career-consulting firm. “Take a step back and ask yourself, is this serving me in any way?” he says. Think about how your manager’s intentions, and your response, will affect your career goals five years down the road. One client Mr. Hellmann coached at a financial-services firm didn’t like her boss’s taking credit for her work, but he gave her other opportunities. “She recognized that he was in her corner,” he says. Soon she was promoted.

Rather than sharing your ideas in meetings or private conversations with the boss, consider creating an email trail and finding a logical reason to copy colleagues, such as asking them for information,

If you take up the issue with your boss, do so in a calm, non-accusatory way, in the context of a broader discussion about your career goals, Mr. Hellmann says. Suggest that you might benefit from more visibility, and say you’d like a chance to present some of your ideas as your own. Be prepared to give examples.

Employees with some status and leverage can occasionally work around such a boss. Get to know managers one level up and chat casually about your work at internal meetings or on coffee breaks.


• Avoid reacting in anger.
• Talk with trusted friends or mentors about what, if anything, you should do.
• Consider conveying your ideas by email, to create a paper trail.
• Ask yourself if your manager is giving you recognition in other ways.
• Weigh the impact on your ability to meet long-term career goals.
• If you raise the issue, do so in the context of a larger career discussion.
• Ask neutral, nonconfrontational questions when discussing it with the boss.
• Model the behavior you’d like to see, giving credit to colleagues with good ideas.

Yet my boss says “I” rather than “we” when presenting them to the team. My annual review is scheduled soon. Can I bring this up? —J.R.

A: Yes, but think it through first. Consider your boss’s point of view. Can you see any way her behavior is benefiting you? Ask trusted co-workers for perspective. You may be learning valuable skills by generating and executing the ideas, or building a portfolio you can use to advance your career. Also, does your boss ever say thank you or express appreciation in other ways, such as saying you have a bright future or mentioning you to higher-ups? Is she giving you other opportunities? Such gestures could be partial payback, suggesting that making your boss look good may be part of your job.

If you raise the topic in your review, be diplomatic, saying something like, “One thing that would be helpful is if I were able to present some of these ideas as my own,” or, “I’m wondering if I might be able to have a little more visibility around these campaigns?” Then, give substantive reasons, such as allowing you to get more input from co-workers to improve the ideas, or growing your network inside the company.

If you become convinced that she’s taking advantage of you, consider making your role more visible to others by creating an email record of your ideas, or mentioning your campaigns casually to other colleagues.

 “When your self-worth at your job plummets, and you feel unnoticed or unimportant, [it’s time to do something about it].”

“It may be an honest mistake or a misunderstanding or a bad habit--and if so, the only way to fix it is to talk about it. Some bosses can learn if you talk to them.”

Approach your boss sooner rather than later. “Waiting will make resentment fester,” Taylor explains. “Start and end the conversation on a positive note and discuss various projects. After your positive comments about the job, say something like, ‘I wanted to mention something that has been on my mind, if this is a good time...It set me back a bit when you mentioned earlier to Joe that you just secured the Smith account. I worked for three months to bring the account in, and it was discouraging. Maybe you had a particular reason for doing that, but I'd like to discuss it with you...’ Remember, always end on a positive note!”

 “Your boss may be insecure about her position or not be adept at letting others shine,” Taylor says. “But you can be a catalyst for showing her the light. Tell her how proud you are of other team members for their specific contributions, and how those are helping her. Over time it will help her see more of the benefits of giving credit; how savvy that makes you look; and how indispensable a team is to her own success.”

 Don’t share ideas exclusively with your boss. “Don’t rely on sharing your ideas with your boss alone; make sure to share them with your team and others, too,” Hockett says. “That way, others will come to know that you were the author of the idea, should it ever make its way throughout the organization by your boss

 Praise your boss publicly. “If your boss is seeking visibility, you might be able to provide some, keeping the exposure away from your separate and distinct projects,” Taylor says. “You don't need to kiss up, but you may be in a staff meeting and be able to announce that your department has now achieved x, looking to your boss proudly. Or you might send an e-mail congratulating her on an achievement.”

 One trick here is to set yourself up to be an information source. For example, tell others they can come to you with questions about the work. If there are details about the work your boss can't provide when asked, politely offer the information to the person making the inquiry. You're not trying to make your boss look unprepared or incompetent here, and in fact, you can still reference your boss well as you answer. Rather, the objective is to show that you have undeniable expertise that only someone closely connected to the job could have.

 Since you don't necessarily want to humiliate your boss in public, praise or agree with them about the project in front of others. Then slip in your own "I" or "we" statements, such as "I'm so glad I was able to be part of this and take care of x on it!", "I'm really honored/flattered you decided to go through with my idea", or "We definitely worked hard together on this!" Your boss will have to acknowledge these statements of inclusion, but at the same time, you're not saying a single bad thing about them.

 If hiring managers ask why you left, respond honestly, but emphasize that values like fairness and cooperation matter to you, and focus on the fact that the situation has reaffirmed your positive sense of ethics and personal direction. You'll look grounded and more trustworthy without badmouthing, which is a win-win for everyone.

 Approach the situation gently by taking the stance that there may be a problem of miscommunication: "I'm sure it wasn't intentional but I noticed my name was left off the reports." This indirect approach will send the message that you're fully aware of what's going on and hopefully it will lead to change.

 Instead of being overcome with disappointment and frustration (although trust me, I was filled with both), I turned the experience into a hard-learned lesson. The next time I had a great idea brewing, I thought through it, planned it out as if I already had buy-in from the group, and piped up to present it at the next team meeting.

  For every project going forward, I proceeded just as I had before, but I also did a bit of extra research. When the presentation rolled around, I had anecdotes and additional data that wasn’t included in my boss’ speech—and I offered them up during the meeting. By being over-prepared and anticipating additional questions, I came across as an expert on the topic, without making my boss look bad.

Save your credit-earning strength for important projects and you’ll help establish yourself as not only an outstanding individual contributor, but a strong team player as well.
