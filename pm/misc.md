People tend to avoid losses than acquiring gains. Therefore, instead of taking stuff from people, construct a scenario where they are willing to give themselves.

that even when people can’t come to an agreement around an issue, they must still leave the room unambiguously committed to a common course of action.

It’s only when colleagues speak up and put their opinions on the table, without holding back, that the leader can confidently fulfill one of his most important responsibilities: breaking ties.

The arc that he draws is: team can’t reach consensus → has a healthy conflict where everyone advocates for their point of view → leader breaks tie and makes a decision → everyone disagrees and commits.

If you have conviction on a particular direction even though there’s no consensus, it’s helpful to say, “Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?” By the time you’re at this point, no one can know the answer for sure, and you’ll probably get a quick yes… This isn’t one way. If you’re the boss, you should do this too. I disagree and commit all the time.

you can commit to a course of action that you disagree with and maintain your integrity in situations where the disagreement stems from the unknown. The disagreement is not about the facts, it’s about what might happen — the 30% of information that we don’t have. Both sides are making educated bets, but either bet can turn out to be true

The team should have strong sense of ownership, no by-stander, no interrruption of each other

Change the culture by exposing the stressful stuations, do it many times if once does not work

System bias can also show up in far more insidious ways. If a team views their responsibility as owning and advocating for a system then they'll find creative ways to fill up sprint plans with work on that system, whether or not that actually matters. The same problem happens within a team when an engineer is a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) for a specific system or sub-component. You'll start seeing features get developed that are good in theory, but which we'd be fine without.

 Formal structures like tech leads can serve to make this even worse if the domains are particularly small. I tend to prefer establishing DRIs for sub-priorities with a team. The DRI is responsible for a sub-priority or sub-component but it's not their identity; they're still expected to work on other stuff on the team and to focus their energies on whatever matters most to the team as a whole.
