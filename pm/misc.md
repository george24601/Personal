# Arrow's impossibility theorem

when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting a specified set of criteria: unrestricted domain, non-dictatorship, Pareto efficiency, and independence of irrelevant alternatives.

In short, the theorem states that no rank-order electoral system can be designed that always satisfies these three "fairness" criteria:

If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.
If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).
There is neither "dictator" nor "prophet": no single voter possesses the power or the knowledge to always determine the group's preference.

### Culture
a critical feature of effective complex organisations is that they make people do all the jobs.

I made the IT staff go and sit with the developers for a couple of weeks as soon as I could. The resistance I got to this idea, even among the keen ones, was deeply surprising to me.

one of the most effective ways to change culture is to fire people.

I was shocked to discover that it was not considered standard to have the overall manager personally vet new hires.

Training is the highest leverage activity a manager can do to increase the output of an organization.

Don’t leave training to outsiders, do it yourself.

never complain your company or your team's task in front your subordinates - and stop the complaints at you! However, it is OK to complain to your boss! 

### silence in conversation

Consider that it only takes four seconds for people to become uncomfortable with silence. So next time you're tempted to break the silence, remember it probably hasn't been very long, and keep mum.

Silence allows time for prospects to comprehend your offer.

When checking in with a friend after they've endured a stressful event, you probably ask, "How are you feeling?" and then listen -- even if it takes them a while to answer.

You probably wouldn't ask, "How are you feeling? Sad? Angry? Stressed? Why? Are you okay?" And yet, this is often what sales reps sound like when they ask a discovery question.

But by letting silence persist -- no matter how uncomfortable -- reps demonstrate interest in the buyer's answer, instead of what they think the buyer's answer could or should be.

But instead of throwing out price discounts or freebies prematurely, simply state your offer -- and then shut up.

When a salesperson asks a question the buyer might not want to answer, silence coaxes them into sharing the truth while making it clear you're prepared to carefully concentrate on their answers.

Sales should be about the buyer and their business, not about the salesperson and their product or service. To ensure the buyer gets exactly what they want out of a sales meeting, sellers should fall silent after explaining a point or presenting a certain argument.

If the magic of awkward silence works (and it usually does), the buyer will guide the conversation. By analyzing what the buyer brings up next, the seller can determine what part of the product or service the buyer is especially interested in or concerned about.

If you feel like you're losing the room (i.e., people are checking email, zoning out, or disengaging), pause for between three and five seconds.

Give your audience time to look up from whatever they're doing. Once your silence has accomplished its goal, touch base with your prospects and ask if you're still on the same page, or if there's anything you can do to make the conversation more meaningful for their business.

pausing before and after critical points in your speech will emphasize important information, pique your audience's interest, and give you a moment to catch your breath. It's tempting to ramble on about important points in your presentation, but give them space and you'll increase their impact.

Most of us engage in listening only as a way of waiting until it's our turn to speak. If you can't resist thinking about what you want to say when listening, focus instead specifically on being silent.

So how should we deal with the uncertainty of silence when it would be inadvisable to (or we simply can’t) let go? Three steps:

* Acknowledge to yourself that you don’t know what the silence means. Resist the temptation to fill in the blank.
* Admit to the other person that you don’t know what the silence means. Ask him to fill in the blank.
* No matter what he says, act as if it’s the truth.

If you get an answer you don’t believe, pretend you believe it anyway. If you’re told she’s been busy and that’s the only reason, then ask her when would be a good time to pick up the conversation again.

“We often think that silence is people simply not speaking,” says Presman. “But it allows both people to settle down and reflect a bit deeper.”

lawyers advised clients giving testimony to think before answering and not jump in immediately. But juries often suspected that a silence before speaking meant the person was concocting a lie, she says. “The intention and the effect of silence are often different.”

If you have to say something, ask a direct question, such as ‘What’s your initial reaction to that offer?’

“Once a silence is getting into 45 seconds you could say, ‘Let’s come back to that in a minute and proceed with the next part of our negotiation.’”

In presentations, silence can be far more effective than dramatic passion, he adds. “Before starting, look at the audience and be silent for a moment because that says, ‘I’m in control. I know what I’m doing. I’m confident.’”
