People tend to avoid losses than acquiring gains. Therefore, instead of taking stuff from people, construct a scenario where they are willing to give themselves.

It’s only when colleagues speak up and put their opinions on the table, without holding back, that the leader can confidently fulfill one of his most important responsibilities: breaking ties.

The arc that he draws is: team can’t reach consensus → has a healthy conflict where everyone advocates for their point of view → leader breaks tie and makes a decision → everyone disagrees and commits.

Change the culture by exposing the stressful stuations, do it many times if once does not work

Individual development plan??

The informed captain on that decision has the responsibility to welcome, understand, and consider your opinions, but may not agree. Once the captain makes a decision, we expect everyone to help make it as successful as possible.

An org's processes, practices, and results are an outcome of people's thinking behaviour

We change by parcticing a different behavior, that, over time, leads us to think about things differently

We are what we repeatedly do. excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit

This should go without saying, but talk to your customers prior to building anything.  People love talking about their problems to anyone who will listen to them.  Often they won’t have the first clue about what a solution looks like, but at the very least repeated similar emotional reactions from many people in a market should tell you that the problem is there and real.  After that, it is “just” a matter of marketing.

 That is 100% avoidable if you simply don’t commit to schedules.  (Also note that committing to a schedule is time debt, by definition.  If you ever say “Yes, I will implement that”, you’ve lost the ability to decide not to implement it if your priorities change.)

 “The only acceptable response to a feature request is: ‘Thank you for your feedback.  I will take it under advisement and consider it for inclusion in a later version of the software.’”  That line actually works.  (There are industries and relationships in which it won’t work — for example, if you’re in a regulated industry and the regulations change, you can’t fob the regulatory authority off with that.  Don’t be in a regulated industry.)

 The person who has decided to bring on one more engineer is not doing it because they love having a geek around the room, they are doing it because adding the geek allows them to complete a project (or projects) which will add revenue or decrease costs.
 => Add revenue.  Reduce costs.  Those are your only goals.

You really want to be attached to Profit Centers because it will bring you higher wages, more respect, and greater opportunities for everything of value to you

Instead, describe yourself by what you have accomplished for previously employers vis-a-vis increasing revenues or reducing costs.  If you have not had the opportunity to do this yet, describe things which suggest you have the ability to increase revenue or reduce costs, or ideas to do so.

A good engineer has a track record of — repeat after me — increasing revenue or decreasing costs.

If you are part of a team effort and the team effort succeeds, the right note to hit is not “I owe it all to my team” unless your position is such that everyone will understand you are lying to be modest.  Try for “It was a privilege to assist my team by leading their efforts with regards to $YOUR_SPECIALTY.”

Actual grooming is at least moderately important, too, because people are hilariously easy to hack by expedients such as dressing appropriately for the situation, maintaining a professional appearance, speaking in a confident tone of voice, etc.  Your business suit will probably cost about as much as a computer monitor.  You only need it once in a blue moon, but when you need it you’ll be really, really, really glad that you have it.  Take my word for it, if I wear everyday casual when I visit e.g. City Hall I get treated like a hapless awkward twenty-something, if I wear the suit I get treated like the CEO of a multinational company.

When you’re new, this is when you are at your most vulnerable. This is because you want to make sense of your environment so you can start being an effective leader.

One reason is that virtually every employee now affects the overall customer experience, even employees who do not directly interact with customers. Most individual episodes cross corporate functions, with any change requiring decisions that span compartmentalized products, policies, operations, channels and technologies. Yet nobody is accountable until the decision reaches a senior executive. Slogging through consensus among dozens of managers, or escalating to a busy executive, is too slow and cumbersome for the many decisions required to deliver a great experience. Each function, moreover, may have very different goals. 

They place more value on adapting to change than on sticking to a plan, and they hold themselves accountable for outcomes (such as growth, profitability and customer loyalty), not outputs (such as lines of code or the number of new products).

When reacting with others, try to respond with more info than answered, to avoid the less information slip

When the message is not clear, guess one direction and trial and error

They take pride in being human shields, absorbing or deflecting heat from inside and outside the company, doing all manner of boring and silly tasks, and battling idiots and slights that make life harder than necessary on their people.

“Guard against the director’s first great vice—rabbiting on, making the same point again and again, getting laughs from your inimitable (and interminable) anecdotes.”

The best bosses orchestrate constructive battles—enabling people to feel safe to speak their minds, even to the leader.

The team members clashed with one another—but these were good fights, built on mutual trust. Indeed, Bird tells his teams, “I want you guys to speak up and drop your drawers. We’re going to look at your scenes in front of everybody. Everyone will get humiliated and encouraged together.”

 If you are a boss, protecting yourself from intrusions may be a lost cause, particularly in the era of e-mail, RSS feeds, and Twitter. But you can run interference for employees, especially those whose work requires concentration, such as engineers, lawyers, nurses, writers, and other knowledge workers.

  But sometimes good bosses face senior leaders and powerful groups that cram bad ideas down everyone’s throat. When your people’s performance or well-being is threatened by idiocy from on high, you need to decide whether to comply or resist, depending on what will help them—and you—most. Sometimes the political costs of defiance are too high, and sometimes seemingly idiotic directives turn out to be useful.

Covering for employees can be painful and risky for a boss, but it can be remarkably effective. It engenders loyalty by demonstrating that you aren’t just spewing out hollow rhetoric about trying to protect them.

The best way to prioritize communication is to regularly schedule time for it. For the uninitiated, this is what a one on one is for.

Is it a coincidence that the percent satisfied with growth is about the same as Gallup’s number for engaged employees?

If a manager isn’t going to have growth discussions with their team members, who will?

it’s important for managers to sit down with their team members and lay out a path for growth.  One on ones are a perfect time to do this, and ensure there’s a time for follow up much sooner than the next review cycle.

they found that people with a mentor to help develop them were much more likely to stick around

When communication breaks down somewhere in the leadership hierarchy, everyone suffers. This is when people feel out of the loop. It’s also when they get frustrated by putting their efforts into work that doesn’t matter.

It’s the job of every manager to help with the flow of information up and down the organization. When people express frustration with leadership, like in the survey above, it’s usually due to a failure in that flow.

Leaders also have a huge impact on the ranks below them. If a leader is disengaged or unhappy, the managers under them are likely to be as well.

One on ones are a huge part of a successful communication architecture, which is why Horowitz devoted an entire chapter to them in his book.

These meetings play a key role in more than just the happiness of front line employees. They also ensure that managers are supported by their superior

Your people are hungry to know how they’re doing. As a manager, you’re best positioned to provide that feedback.

You want to see your best people thrive, and your other people rise to acceptable levels. A healthy mix of feedback and praise can do that, all while helping prevent turnover.

The chart above summarizes his findings, which show that Motivators have the greater impact; Motivators account for over 80% of job satisfaction, while also contributing to nearly 1/3rd of the causes of dissatisfaction.

Unfortunately, many companies have over-invested in hygiene factors. High pay, tons of perks, and over-investment in superficial aspects of “company culture” represent the wrong end of the 80-20 rule for impacting the motivation of your people.

Perks can be expensive, but they’re easy. Once you add a perk, it just continues to be a line item on your budget. There’s little you have to think about.

Meanwhile, Motivators are inexpensive, but time-consuming

The next time you think about adding a perk, challenge yourself how beneficial it will really be for your company. Avoid the trap of choosing perks rather than the hard work of improving your managers.

You have to care deeply about your people, but not what they think of you

The way many companies structure their real-time feedback approach is geared towards reaction as opposed to response.

Reaction is immediate and visceral. It’s tied to our reptilian brains, and loaded with emotion.

Response is more thoughtful and measured. It’s high-context, and actionable.

Also, while for the most severe issues immediate response is necessary, in most cases a conversation with context and background would be more effective.

A real conversation would also allow the employee to understand the different parts of whatever the issue at hand is. You could then talk about next steps and ways to avoid the issue in the future.

The Solution: Have regular 1 on 1s between managers and their team members.

Some of the best training and coaching is when one peer teaches another, or a manager coaches their team members

Training programs don’t necessarily need to be expensive, formalized events, but they do need to be intentional.

Talk about great managers as your company's No. 1 benefit.


https://hbr.org/2018/01/why-people-really-quit-their-jobs
Most companies design jobs and then slot people into them. Our best managers sometimes do the opposite: When they find talented people, they’re open to creating jobs around them.

The best go out of their way to help people do work they enjoy — even if it means rotating them out of roles where they’re excelling.

 In the first week on the job, managers sit down with their new hires and ask them about their favorite projects they’ve done, the moments when they’ve felt most energized at work, the times when they’ve found themselves totally immersed in a state of flow, and the passions they have outside their jobs. Armed with that knowledge, managers can build engaging roles from the start.

As managers learn who knows what, they can connect the dots — or better yet, build a searchable database of experts. The goal is to put employees’ strengths on display so that people know whom to contact.

https://hbr.org/2017/07/new-managers-should-focus-on-helping-their-teams-not-pleasing-their-bosses

The experts recommend that you focus on demonstrating your vision, supporting and leading teamwork, and recognizing those who make significant contributions. You might, for example, make a point of listening more than talking to make clear that you value the expertise of your direct reports.

 I think it signaled to them that I cared about their opinion and expertise, and that I was not assuming I was a one-man band. I also made a point of speaking well of them to my boss in private and in public,

 Being treated with respect was more important to employees than recognition and appreciation, communicating an inspiring vision, providing useful feedback — even opportunities for learning, growth, and development.

Leaders also need to be role models for civility. One surefire way to communicate how much you value civility is to directly evaluate and reward it during performance reviews. Include metrics on interpersonal skills or emotional competence. Introduce peer and customer recognition and rewards is to catch people in the act and reinforce respectful behaviors.

summary - details to support - summary

deadline is the best driver: so small deadlines

Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive

structured procastination - work on something importatnt but not urgetn!

the true end of task - complete work and get evaluation

Cold reading??

Elicit Value??

stay silent to see if the other side can pursue you

don't mention things you hear in different locations, at least don't frame as such

find a way to reply with equal or more amount of information to keep conversation going

when commenting, compare with the same person's previous product, to cushion the shocks


company wellness initiatives are not the primary way to respond to that stress. Our data suggests that while wellness initiatives can be helpful, a much bigger lever is the work itself. HR should work with front-line managers to monitor the level of demands they’re placing on people, as well as the balance between demands and resources. The higher the work demands, the higher employees’ need for support, acknowledgement, or opportunities for recovery.
