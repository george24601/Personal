Companies do not act on the basis of the best evidence. They merge even though much research shows that mergers destroy value. They use forced-curve ranking systems for performance reviews even though extensive evidence documents the harmful effects. There is no reason to believe they would behave any differently with respect to their human capital.

Evidence shows work hours are negatively related to productivity, that giving people more autonomy leads to higher motivation, and that layoffs often harm performance, including profits. So in making employees sick, employers have created a lose-lose situation.

We know that measurement affects behaviour. What gets measured gets managed. What gets measured improves; what isnâ€™t measured is ignored and often gets worse. The single simplest and easiest thing to do is to measure the health effects of workplaces on people.
