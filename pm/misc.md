Companies do not act on the basis of the best evidence. They merge even though much research shows that mergers destroy value. They use forced-curve ranking systems for performance reviews even though extensive evidence documents the harmful effects. There is no reason to believe they would behave any differently with respect to their human capital.

Evidence shows work hours are negatively related to productivity, that giving people more autonomy leads to higher motivation, and that layoffs often harm performance, including profits. So in making employees sick, employers have created a lose-lose situation.

#Arrow's impossibility theorem

when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting a specified set of criteria: unrestricted domain, non-dictatorship, Pareto efficiency, and independence of irrelevant alternatives.

In short, the theorem states that no rank-order electoral system can be designed that always satisfies these three "fairness" criteria:

If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.
If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).
There is neither "dictator" nor "prophet": no single voter possesses the power or the knowledge to always determine the group's preference.

#Culture

While I had to be careful not to get into the weeds, by getting my hands dirty my credibility with the team grew.

a critical feature of effective complex organisations is that they make people do all the jobs.

I made the IT staff go and sit with the developers for a couple of weeks as soon as I could. The resistance I got to this idea, even among the keen ones, was deeply surprising to me.

one of the most effective ways to change culture is to fire people.

I was shocked to discover that it was not considered standard to have the overall manager personally vet new hires.

I did know the difference between a bright young thing and an irritating know-all, so I took responsibility for any new hires. I deferred to my colleagues on knowledge calls, but that was not often a deciding factor either way. Far more important was how useful they would make themselves.

Training is the highest leverage activity a manager can do to increase the output of an organization.

Donâ€™t leave training to outsiders, do it yourself.
