# Arrow's impossibility theorem

when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting a specified set of criteria: unrestricted domain, non-dictatorship, Pareto efficiency, and independence of irrelevant alternatives.

In short, the theorem states that no rank-order electoral system can be designed that always satisfies these three "fairness" criteria:

If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.
If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).
There is neither "dictator" nor "prophet": no single voter possesses the power or the knowledge to always determine the group's preference.

### Culture
a critical feature of effective complex organisations is that they make people do all the jobs.

I made the IT staff go and sit with the developers for a couple of weeks as soon as I could. The resistance I got to this idea, even among the keen ones, was deeply surprising to me.

one of the most effective ways to change culture is to fire people.

I was shocked to discover that it was not considered standard to have the overall manager personally vet new hires.

Training is the highest leverage activity a manager can do to increase the output of an organization.

Don’t leave training to outsiders, do it yourself.

never complain your company or your team's task in front your subordinates - and stop the complaints at you! However, it is OK to complain to your boss! 

### difficult talk

If you expect the discussion to go poorly, it will be clear during the conversation itself. Positive visioning is helpful in any endeavor, and difficult conversations are no different. Before the conversation, think about your ideal outcome. It’s very possible that the conversation will go much better than you initially thought.

You may want to write down your talking points beforehand, but preparing an entire script is unreasonable. It’s unlikely that the conversation will go exactly as planned. A script could create a situation where you are delivering a monologue instead of finding a solution together through dialogue.

It’s important that you tell the truth during the conversation, but it’s equally important that you use language that your counterpart will be receptive to. Being either too blunt or too vague decreases your chances of achieving your desired result.

Slowing down helps you to be more conscious about what you are saying. If you can feel yourself getting defensive or reactive, pause and take a breath.

Place both feet on the floor and put your hands on your knees. Face the person you’re talking with.

One reason to put conclusion first is to help form the first impression, and trick person into confirmation bias
