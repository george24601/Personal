# Arrow's impossibility theorem

when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting a specified set of criteria: unrestricted domain, non-dictatorship, Pareto efficiency, and independence of irrelevant alternatives.

In short, the theorem states that no rank-order electoral system can be designed that always satisfies these three "fairness" criteria:

If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.
If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).
There is neither "dictator" nor "prophet": no single voter possesses the power or the knowledge to always determine the group's preference.

# Culture

a critical feature of effective complex organisations is that they make people do all the jobs.

I made the IT staff go and sit with the developers for a couple of weeks as soon as I could. The resistance I got to this idea, even among the keen ones, was deeply surprising to me.

one of the most effective ways to change culture is to fire people.

I was shocked to discover that it was not considered standard to have the overall manager personally vet new hires.

Training is the highest leverage activity a manager can do to increase the output of an organization.

Donâ€™t leave training to outsiders, do it yourself.

never complain your company or your team's task in front your subordinates - and stop the complaints at you! However, it is OK to complain to your boss!
