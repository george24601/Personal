Is the defect from the user story of the current sprint or from work done in the past?

If it is from current sprint, then it is not "Done"

quality is a mutal agreement between the Dev Team and Product Owner

e.g., mvp vs scalable debate with PO => over time, the PO and Dev Team build a shared undestanding of the boundray of quality => dev must
fix bugs above the quality line, and need to do that wihtin the sprint, Product Backlog item cannot be consdiered done until this defect is corrected
=> otherwise, won't fix it right away

=> delete the defect or close it with a resolution like "won't fix", if it is not worth fixing a defect right now, it's not likely that we will find the time to reutrn to it later => also more and more expensive over time to correct the problem

Our goal is not to fix all known defects but to deliver a valuable product to our customers!

If the bug we can quickly solve it and it will not impact the forecast for our spirnt, we fix it and move on. If it is huge and above quality threasold, put it on top of the backlog => if it doesn't matter enough ot make the next sprint's backlog, we should just delete it!

backlog is not a trash can! keep it short!

if a bug is critical enough but we havn't fixed it, it will remind us about ITSELF -- don't worry about that, it will reappear again!

If you are fixng all problems that appear, most likely you are missing an opportunity to do something more valuable

Cost of fixing defects after deployment is 100 times higher than when it was found and fixed in the design stage.

Dev lead will define the definition of done, and get the product owner's buy in!
