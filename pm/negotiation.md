### That is not all

When offering or conceding something to somebody, rather than give it to them as a final item, give it in incremental pieces. Do not allow them to respond to each piece you give them -- keep on offering more.

The increments can be in different amounts, but each should surprise and delight the person. It can also help if the final increment is particularly desirable

The method depends largely on an automatic social response and hence works better when the customer does not have time to think hard about what is going on.

### Fear-Then-Relief 

Invoke fear in the other person. Then, when they seek a solution, provide one that leads them in the direction you choose.

Fear is invoked by threatening needs. Relief may be gained by doing what you request. Relief may also given 'freely' to create trust and invoke the rules of social exchange.

Be careful not to be seen as an aggressor, for example by using external sources to invoke the fear.

Also be careful not to invoke so much fear that they flee from you or become aggressive.

This is a direct application of the hurt and rescue principle, creating discomfort and then providing the means of reducing that discomfort. Whilst a relatively crude method, it is still quite common and often effective when done well.

This works as the pleasant relief is linked with the second request, which receives the pleasant emotion by association. In the state of blessed relief the person may also be temporarily unthinking as the strong emotion overwhelms any rational consideration.

Repeated fear-relief cycles can be emotionally very exhausting and is used in such as interrogation and conversion to break a person down. When a person thinks they are rescued from a fearful situation, they relax and drop their guard, making the next wave even more terrifying as they are less and less able to  emotional defend against it.

Invoking fear can be hazardous as it may well trigger the Fight-or-Flight reaction. Particularly when the persuader is seen as the primary cause of the discomfort, they may become the target of aggression and compliance will become very unlikely. One way this can be handled is that the persuader pleads innocence or unintentional action

### Selling The Top Of The Line (TOTL)

First promote an expensive product. Then show them a cheaper product.

This can be done without really trying to sell the expensive product. Do it as if you are just a kind of product geek who is proud of what can be done and want to show off great products. Then become the friend who sells them a product that suits them best.

You can also try to sell the expensive product if they seem to be interested. Expensive products are sought by the affluent and those who value the social kudos the product gives. If they seem like the latter, add 'what people will say' into your patter.

If they reject the expensive product, then it is a simple step to move down to the cheaper product.

Selling the top of the line' is a common approach that is a variant of the Door In The Face (DITF) method.

Acting as a 'product geek' in showing off the more expensive item establishes the sales person as an expert and can help to build trust. Note that serious attempts to sell the expensive product may negate or even invert these effects.

The more expensive product creates desire, but cannot be afforded. The second product hooks into the created desire with something that is closer to the buyers budget. The method uses the contrast principle to make the second product appear relatively inexpensive.
