# change attitudes by changing behavior 

[source](https://opentextbc.ca/socialpsychology/chapter/changing-attitudes-by-changing-behavior/)

It turns out that if we engage in a behavior, and particularly one that we had not expected that we would have, our thoughts and feelings toward that behavior are likely to change.

Insufficient justification occurs when the threat or reward is actually sufficient to get the person to engage in or to avoid a behavior, but the threat or reward is insufficient to allow the person to conclude that the situation caused the behavior.

Overjustification occurs when we view our behavior as caused by the situation, leading us to discount the extent to which our behavior was actually caused by our own interest in it

This research suggests that, although giving rewards may in many cases lead us to perform an activity more frequently or with more effort, reward may not always increase our liking for the activity. In some cases, reward may actually make us like an activity less than we did before we were rewarded for it. And this outcome is particularly likely when the reward is perceived as an obvious attempt on the part of others to get us to do something.

On the other hand, rewards that are seen as more internal to the activity, such as rewards that praise us, remind us of our achievements in the domain, and make us feel good about ourselves as a result of our accomplishments, are more likely to be effective in increasing not only the performance of, but also the liking of, the activity

if we want someone to develop a strong attitude, we should use the smallest reward or punishment that is effective in producing the desired behavior.

No wonder that most of us believe the statement, “If I had it all to do over again, I would not change anything important.”

having too many choices can create dissonance and thus the opportunity

people report being happier when they are given a free gift than when they are given a choice between two similar gifts and have to reject one of them

The foot-in-the-door technique refers to a persuasion attempt in which we first get the target to accept a rather minor request, and then we ask for a larger request.

once people label themselves as the kind of person who conforms to the requests of others in the relevant domain , it is easier to get them to conform later

Instead of having the people who take the reservations say, “Please call if you change your plans,” they could instead ask, “Will you call us if you change your plans?” and then wait for the person to say yes. The act of saying yes to a simple request creates commitment to the behavior, and not following through on the promise would be likely to create cognitive dissonance.

low-ball technique. In this case, the salesperson promises the customer something desirable, such as a low price on a car, with the intention of getting the person to imagine himself or herself engaging in the desired behavior

The door-in-the-face technique begins by making an unreasonably large request; for example, asking a fellow student if he or she would be willing to take notes on your behalf for the entire semester. Assuming the student declines, you might then suggest a compromise by requesting that the student only shares his or her notes from the most recent class.

The pre-giving technique also relies on the norm of reciprocity. In this case, a charitable organization might mail you a small, unsolicited gift, followed by a request for a monetary donation.

# Potential Paths to Persuasion
Commitment and Consistency	We are more likely to honor a commitment if we commit to it orally, in writing, or in public.
Reciprocity	We feel obligated to return a favor.
Social Proof	We tend to follow what others are doing.
Authority	We tend to obey authority figures.
Liking	We are more easily persuaded by people that we like.
Scarcity	Opportunities are more valuable to us when they are less available.
