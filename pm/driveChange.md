# How To Drive Change as a Software Engineer

[Original](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/HowToDriveChangeasaSoftwareEngineer.html)

Persuading people to change long held belief is hard work. Having a good idea is just the start of that process.

Maybe a small team of 5 people can wrap things up and pivot quickly in a week, but larger organizations of 50 or 100 people can easily takes months to start moving. And that's totally normal!

Just because the "technical" part of your idea can be implemented in a week or a month doesn't mean you should expect an organization to be able to react that quickly. Things take time, and you need to be able to delay gratification and keep pushing for your idea even when any expected "win" is far in the future.

This is expected. If everyone already thinks your idea is a good one, they would have implemented it themselves already!

Getting to "no" is just one of many steps in getting to "yes", which is itself just one of many steps to changing how an organization does it's work.

Social proof often matters as much - if not more - than logic & facts. "Someone you respect says this is a good idea" is a very convincing argument!

People can be swayed by well-chosen words, even if they convey nothing the individuals do not already know

People are social animals; they often rely heavily on what their peers think in forming their own opinions, and even if they think differently may find it hard to object over the will of the majority.

You cannot think of the people-stuff as "getting in the way" of whatever technical work you want to do: when dealing with an organization, the people-stuff is the work! It is just another challenge you can try to understand, learn, and make progress with.

there are a pool of people who may very well be receptive to your idea right-off-the-bat, without needing any further persuasion. These may not be the "right" people you need to persuade to implement your idea, but they are useful nonetheless:

Perhaps they aren't in the right positions now, but may end up in the right position in future. Organizations change, and someone random you sell the idea to now may move into a position later where they can be useful

They can help you convince the right people that your idea is worth pursuing: people tend to conform to the opinions of those around them, and leaders often rely on their team to help them evaluate ideas & proposals

These are table-stakes:

You must be coherent: the follow of arguments or logic should be clear in your words. A reasonable person should be able to see how one point leads to another, even if they may not agree every step of the way.

You be concise: nobody likes rambling speeches or repetitive documents. Excessive verbosity can easily distract from the core message you can to convey

You need to be factually correct: no factual errors. If you are unsure of facts, make sure you find out before trying to use them. Nothing turns people off like basic factual errors in a proposal

Sometimes just quietly pushing things along yourself gets you what you want faster than trying to argue for headcount up-front, and can put your idea in a better state to argue for headcount after (e.g. you've put together a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the value).

Be extremely conscious of the limits of what you can do yourself, but be willing to "just do it" strategically if you think it's the fastest way to get your idea into a place you want it to be.

Re-introducing the idea to the same people won't change the rejection. But introducing new facts could.

New facts could include: Grassroots Opinions, Social Proof, Proof-of-concept results

The basic principle behind building momentum is you need to make sure there is a feedback loop between the effort going in, resulting in perceived benefit that justifies more effort.

The basic approach to getting momentum is planning the work to ensure that the feedback loop exists, and then leveraging whatever assets you have to begin with to give the project a push. You may have to argue for your own time, call in favors from friends, prepare your best pitches & rhetoric to try and convince people, all to try and catch the positive cycle where people start seeing benefit, and the project can begin coasting on its own (partial) success.

you should try to get a commitment from them: exactly what would it take to get them to say "Yes"?

When pushing for an idea, as much as possible you should know what every individual who has a say in the change, regardless of how small, thinks of it:

Who supports it already?
Who is on the fence?
Who thinks it's a bad idea?
Why?

The way around this problem is to change consensus one individual at a time: find people who you think may be interested, and pitch your idea to them to see if they bite. If they're not interested, move on. If they are, bring the interested individuals together. At this point you have an interest group of people who support your idea. This means:

People who are interested can discuss the idea and how to push it forward, rather than brooding in isolation
It's no longer "one guy with an idea", it's now an group, with many people interested, and more legitimacy in the eyes of critics and supporters alike
You have people who you can leverage to do the necessary work to get momentum going.

you'll eventually get most people, perhaps including the important decision makers, interested. That is the point to call a big meeting - or send out a wide email, to use the circular nature of consensus in your favor:

To make sure any last hold-outs are aware of everyone else who supports your idea, which can help convince them

You make sure everyone who supports your idea is aware of everyone else who also supports it, which reinforces their support

And at that point, you have successfully formed a new consensus that you can use to push your idea forward!
