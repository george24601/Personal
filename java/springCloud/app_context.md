### Bean

This annotation is used on classes that define beans. @Configuration is an analog for an XML configuration file â€“ it is configuration using Java classes. A Java class annotated with @Configuration is a configuration by itself and will have methods to instantiate and configure the dependencies.

Spring Configuration annotation indicates that the class has @Bean definition methods. So Spring container can process the class and generate Spring Beans to be used in the application.

The @Bean annotation works with @Configuration to create Spring beans. As mentioned earlier, @Configuration will have methods to instantiate and configure dependencies. Such methods will be annotated with @Bean. The method annotated with this annotation works as the bean ID, and it creates and returns the actual bean.

### How BeanFactory works

1. getBean in beanDefinitionMap
2. createBeanInstance. 
  * By reflection, create new instance object by BeanDefinition's class object, and get a new bean object
  * doCreatBean - assign the new bean object to Bean definition, and inject properties in BeanDefinition to Bean  
3. initializeBean - postProcessBeforeINitialiization, and postProcessAfterInitialization


### ApplicationContext

1. Inherits from BeanFactory, but no methods
2. AbstractAC. First accepts BeanFactory
  * loadBeanDefintions. Read BeanDefinition and write to AC's BeanFactory
  * registerBeanPostProcessors. Find BeanPostProcessor from BF, and put them in beganPostProcessors 
  * onRefresh - init all beans

The ApplicationContext is the central interface within a Spring application for providing configuration information to the application. It is read-only at run time, but can be reloaded if necessary and supported by the application. AC targetes at Spring user, whereas BeanFactory(BF) targets more toward Spring developer, which defines how Bean is inited.

* Bean factory methods for accessing application components.
* The ability to load file resources in a generic fashion.
* The ability to publish events to registered listeners.
* The ability to resolve messages to support internationalization.
* Inheritance from a parent context.

In the code above, there are two arguments to the bean definition: RedisConnectionFactory and MessageListenerAdapter. The method expresses its needs and Spring's DI container will supply them assuming they are available. While it's possible to fetch these beans directly the an instance of ApplicationContext, such a solution leans too heavily on container APIs and is not necessary.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan
public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer {

    @SuppressWarnings("resource")
    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        ConfigurableApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);

        context.getBean(Table.class).fillWithTestdata(); // <-- here
    }
}

//alternatively
@EventListener(ApplicationReadyEvent.class)
public void doSomethingAfterStartup() {
    System.out.println("hello world, I have just started up");
}

//yet another option


@Component
public class ApplicationStartup 
implements ApplicationListener<ApplicationReadyEvent> {

  /**
   * This event is executed as late as conceivably possible to indicate that 
   * the application is ready to service requests.
   */
  @Override
  public void onApplicationEvent(final ApplicationReadyEvent event) {

    // here your code ...

    return;
  }
}
//As an alternative, you can do this using @EventListenerannotation on a Bean method, passing as argument the class event you want to hook to
```
