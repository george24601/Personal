CyclicBarrier

AIO vs NIO, AIO? Netty?

object life cycle from creation to destruction

protential problem with bouldless blocking queue?

Generics, type erasing at compile time, so that run time has no type info

Example of type unchecked warning,e.g.,  List<String> rawList = new ArrayList()

class type.newInstance, ConstructorType.newInstance - classType newInstance calls reflection constructor type's parameter-less methods

memory - during object creation and destruction, what memory region is affected

class object

When will reflection not get the params?
