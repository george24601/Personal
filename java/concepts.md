CyclicBarrier

AIO vs NIO, AIO? mmap, sendfile

object life cycle from creation to destruction

distributed session settings, consistency, idempotency

protential problem with bouldless blocking queue?

Generics, type erasing at compile time, so that run time has no type info

Design: use generics to implement LRU, hints: LinkedHashMap, removeEldestEntry()

Example of type unchecked warning,e.g.,  List<String> rawList = new ArrayList()

class type.newInstance, ConstructorType.newInstance - classType newInstance calls reflection constructor type's parameter-less methods

gc - when, how, different gc strategy?

memory - during object creation and destruction, what memory region is affected

G1 vs CMS

class object

string pool will NOT be GCed - string pool concat is done at COMPILE time, at RUNTIME, created is put on heap e.g. "TEST" + myVar 

Difference between Thread.run and Thread.start

When will reflection not get the params?

Netty vs NIO
