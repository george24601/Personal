Hashmap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap, HashTab, thread-safe maps. How concurrentMap works

CyclicBarrier

NIO - selector, blocking and non-blocking

class loader - double parent delegation

object life cycle from creation to destruction

volatile - visibility

Design: deduct money not into negative (distirbuted transaction and lock), Idempotency (can not deduct more than once)

distributed session settings, consistency, idempotency

use of jmap and jutil?

protential problem with bouldless blocking queue?

Deign: service's interfact implementation, load balance and route robin between 3 IPs (consider concurrency case)

Generics, type erasing, < ? extends T>, <? super T>, and <?>,

Design: use generics to implement LRU, hints: LinkedHashMap, removeEldestEntry()

can you pass List<String> as List<Object> param? How about vice versa?  

Example of type unchecked warning,e.g.,  List<String> rawList = new ArrayList()

class type.newInstance, ConstructorType.newInstance - classType newInstance calls reflection constructor type's parameter-less methods

dual parent loading - same class as java class name? different types of class loader?

gc - when, how, different gc strategy?

memory - during object creation and destruction, what memory region is affected

G1 vs CMS

BIO vs NIO

ConcurrentHashMap vs HashMap
