# Memory model

Each thread running in the Java virtual machine has its own thread stack.
The thread stack also contains all local variables for each method being executed (all methods on the call stack)

All local variables of primitive types ( boolean, byte, short, char, int, long, float, double - no String) are fully stored on the thread stack and are thus not visible to other threads.

The heap contains all objects created in your Java application, regardless of what thread created the object.

An object may contain methods and these methods may contain local variables. These local variables are also stored on the thread stack, even if the object the method belongs to is stored on the heap.

An object's member variables are stored on the heap along with the object itself. That is true both when the member variable is of a primitive type, and if it is a reference to an object.

Static class variables are also stored on the heap along with the class definition.

methods, thread stacks, and native handles are allocated in memory separate from the heap

1. Heap 

2. Method Area, also known as perm gen. stores type, constant, staic var, JIT compiled code
	
	1.  runtime constant pool in NO LONGER in method area

	2. 


3. VM Stack(includeing stack frames) -thread local

4. native method stack  -thread local. In Hotspot VM Stack and Method Stack are combined.)

5. program coutner register  - thread local


local var table needed ram space is determned during compliation, when entering a method, the size of stack frame is fixed, so it won't change local var table's size

Method Area: 

	every type's struct info: RCP, String ,and method data, constructor,and normal method's string content
	
	type , instance,interface's special method required on init

1. java memory regions?

2. what happened when java creates an object?

3. visit an object, handle and direct pointer?

4. string type and constant pool

# Offheap/Native/Direct memory

Direct memory: is similar to native, but also implies that an underlying buffer within the hardware is being shared. For example buffer within the network adapter or graphics display. The goal here is to reduce the number of times the same bytes is being copied about in memory.

Given a direct byte buffer, the Java virtual machine will make a best effort to perform native I/O operations directly upon it. That is, it will attempt to avoid copying the buffer's content to (or from) an intermediate buffer before (or after) each invocation of one of the underlying operating system's native I/O operations. 

However, the application still uses an object on the Java heap to orchestrate I/O operations, but the buffer that holds the data is held in native memory, the Java heap object only contains a reference to the native heap buffer.

The new I/O (NIO) classes introduced a new way of performing I/O based on channels and buffers. NIO added support for direct ByteBuffers, which can be passed directly to native memory rather than Java heap. Making them significantly faster in some scenarios because they can avoid copying data between Java heap and native heap.

Scalability to large memory sizes e.g. over 1 TB and larger than main memory.

Notional impact on GC pause times.

Sharing between processes, reducing duplication between JVMs, and making it easier to split JVMs.

Persistence for faster restarts or replying of production data in test.

The use of off heap memory gives you more options in terms of how you design your system.  The most important improvement is not performance, but determinism.

By storing all your input events and data off heap in a persisted way you can turn your critical systems into a series of complex state machines. (Or in simple cases, just one state machine)

The biggest issue with off heap is your data structures become less natural.  You either need a simple data structure which can be mapped directly to off heap, or you have a complex data structure which serializes and deserializes to put it off heap.

Use cases:

1. session cache in the server app: inactive sessions stored on offheap

2. medium to long lived mutable objects

3. stores keys on heap and values off heap

1. jmap -heap
check new and old jen size

2. jmap -histo:live
