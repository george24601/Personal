Tags are converted to lowercase.

For optimal functionality, we recommend constructing tags that use the key:value syntax.

device, host, and source are reserved tag keys and cannot be specified in the standard way
You can also enter tags: followed by a tag to see all the events that come from a host or integration with that tag. The example in the image is the tag role:cassandra. So the search text is tags:role:cassandra

A custom metric refers to a single, unique combination of a metric name, host, and any tags.

Note that the ordering of tags does not matter


The easiest way to get your custom application metrics into Datadog is to send them to DogStatsD, a metrics aggregation service bundled with the Datadog Agent.

As it receives data, DogStatsD aggregates multiple data points for each unique metric into a single data point over a period of time called the flush interval. 


1. edit your datadog.yaml file to uncomment the following lines

```
use_dogstatsd: yes
dogstatsd_port: 8125

```

you could compare the performance of two algorithms by tagging a timer metric with the algorithm version

```
@statsd.timed('algorithm.run_time', tags=['algorithm:one'])
def algorithm_one():
    # Do fancy things here ...

@statsd.timed('algorithm.run_time', tags=['algorithm:two'])
def algorithm_two():
    # Do fancy things (maybe faster?) here ...
```

The format for sending metrics is metric.name:value|type|@sample_rate|#tag1:value,tag2,

Metric types: 

1. Gauges:  value of a particular thing over time. If called multiple times during a check’s execution for a metric only the last sample is used.

2. Rate: it’s the value variation of a metric on a defined time interval.Submit the sampled raw value of your counter. Don’t normalize the values to a rate, or calculate the deltas before submitting - the Agent does both for you. Should only be called once during a check.
Throws away any value that is less than a previously submitted value. IE the counter should be monotonically increasing.
Stored as a GAUGE type in the Datadog web application. Each value in the stored timeseries is a time-normalized delta of the counter’s value between samples.
