1. backup all config files (of course!)
2. All brokers are upgraded before clients, because clients from older release works with new brokers. Client incldues any application uses
Kafka producer/consumer, including but not limited to, Cmaus, Schema Registry, and REstProxy.
Speical case: client on the same node as broker!
3. supports rolling upgrades: upgrade one broker at a time, but need to upgrade ALL kafka brokers
4. upgrade SR, RP, and Camus,i.e.,all clients
