Curator has always been a command-line tool. This site provides the documentation for how to use Curator on the command-line.

note that Curator only requires access to a client node in the Elasticsearch cluster to work. It does not need to be installed on one of the nodes in the cluster.

You can use environment variable references in the both the configuration file and the action file to set values that need to be configurable at runtime.
