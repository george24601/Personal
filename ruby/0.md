the exact semantics of || are:

if first expression is not nil or false, return it
if first expression is nil or false, return the second expression

Any Ruby object can be frozen by using the freeze method. When an object is frozen, any attempt to change this object will result in a RuntimeError exception.

reflection: every object has class and methods objects

call itself => self.m

All instance variables start with an @, @@ => class variables

Create instance => Foo.new(,...)

Foo.new create a new instance of Foo and before Foo.new returns, call the new
object's initialize method with all the arguments passed to Foo.new

class constant: starts with a capital letter instead of @@. Should not mutate
it. Publicly visible. To access, use :: ,e.g., Math::PI

class method:

in class C:

```ruby
def self.method_name args
..
end
```

=> C.method_anme args

getter and setter => methods are public by default:

```ruby
def foo
 @foo
end

def foo= x
@foo =x
end
```

conditials treats everything but false and nil as true

nil? method

Often convenicent for methods to return self so that subsequent method calls
can be put together

duck-typing:

```ruby
def mirror_update pt
	pt.x = pt.x * -1
end
```

=> normally in place unless you use instance_of? or is_a?
-----
Array.new(x) creates an array of length x with each index initially mapped to
nil

Array.new(5) {|i| -i} =>

can hold objects that are instances of different classes

negative array indices

no array-bound errors => nil for getter, grow array for setter

+ and | operator

push, pop, shift, unshift
---------

```ruby

int.times {puts "hi"}

y = 7 
[4,6,8].each {y += 1}

sum = 0
[4,6,8].each {|x| 
sum += x
puts sum
}
```

But blocks are not objects. can NOT pass them as arguments to a method.
Rather, any method can be passed either 0 or 1 blocks, sepearte from the other
arguments.

inject is like fold
sum = [4,6,8].inject(0) {|acc, elt| acc + elt}

map, select (filter in ML), any?, all?

-------
using blocks => yield keyword. e.g, prints "hi" 3 times

```ruby

def foo x
	if x
		yield
	else
		yield
		yield
foo true {puts "hi"}
foo false{puts "hi"}
```

pass arguments to a block => yield (8, "str")

a recursive method passing block

```ruby

def coutn i
	if yield i
	1
	else
	1 + (count (i+ 1) { |x| yield x})
	end
end

```
------
Blocks are NOT closures because they are not objects => they are not
"first-class values", which is something that can be stored and passed like
anything else in the language

Suppose we want to create an array of blocks => cant because array holds
objects are blocks are not objects, but we can use lambda to create an array
of instances of Proc

```ruby
c = a.map {|x| lambda {|y| x >= y}}

c[2].call 17
j = c.count {|x| x.call(5)}

```
-------

Hashes

{"SML" => 7, "Racket" =>12, "Ruby" => 42}

keys, values, delete, each, inject

Range (2...10) => because of duck typing, most methods using array can accept
range as well.

---
class C < D ...end

reflection => superclass method
is_a? instance_of? => in conflict with duck typing

-----

```ruby
class Point
attr_accessor :x, :y

def initialize(x,y)
	@x = x
	@y = y
end

def distFromOrigin
	Math.sqrt(@x * @x + @y * @y)
end

def distFromOrigin2
	Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)//uses getter method
end

end

class ColorPoint < Point
attr_accessor :color

def initialize(x,y,c="clear")
	super(x,y) //not required but often desired
	@color = c
end

end
```

-----
Dynamic dispatch explained

support we have call e0.m(e1,....,en)

1.Evaluate e0,e1,...en to values obj0, obj1,...,objn
2.Get the calss of obj0 (think of the class as part of the state of obj0)
3.Suppose obj0 has class A, if m is defined in A, call that method. Otherwise, call the super classes recursivly
4.bind self to obj0 (different from FP), obj1...objn to x1....xn

Step 4 is what called "late-binding", "dynamic dispatch", "virtual method call"


------
Dynamic dispatch vs Closures

Example: two ML functions
=> this creates two closures that both have the other closure in their environment => lexical scoping => subclass and dynamic dispatch would violate it

Overriding and dynamic dispatch is the biggest thing that distinguishes oop from functional programming
